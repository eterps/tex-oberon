How could anyone diligently concentrate on his work on an afternoon
with such warmth, splendid sunshine, and blue sky. This rhetorical
question was one I asked many times while spending a sabbatical leave
in California in 1985. Back home everyone would feel compelled to
profit from the sunny spells to enjoy life at leisure in the
country-side, wandering or engaging in one's favourite sport. But
here, every day was like that, and giving in to such temptations would
have meant the end of all work. And, had I not chosen this location in
the world because of its inviting, enjoyable climate?

Fortunately, my work was also enticing, making it easier to buckle
down. I had the privilege of sitting in front of the most advanced and
powerful workstation anywhere, learning the secrets of perhaps the
newest fad in our fast developing trade, pushing colored rectangles
from one place of the screen to another. This all had to happen under
strict observance of rules imposed by physical laws and by the newest
technology. Fortunately, the advanced computer would complain
immediately if such a rule was violated, it was a rule checker and
acted like your big brother, preventing you from making steps towards
disaster. And it did what would have been impossible for oneself,
keeping track of thousands of constraints among the thousands of
rectangles laid out. This was called computer-aided design. ``Aided'' is
rather a euphemism, but the computer did not complain about the
degradation of its role.

While my eyes were glued to the colorful display, and while I was
confronted with the evidence of my latest inadequacy, in through the
always open door stepped my colleague (\acro{JG}). He also happened to spend
a leave from duties at home at the same laboratory, yet his face did
not exactly express happiness, but rather frustration. The chocolate
bar in his hand did for him what the coffee cup or the pipe does for
others, providing temporary relaxation and distraction. It was not the
first time he appeared in this mood, and without words I guessed its
cause. And the episode would reoccur many times.

His days were not filled with the great fun of rectangle-pushing; he
had an assignment. He was charged with the design of a compiler for
the same advanced computer. Therefore, he was forced to deal much more
closely, if not intimately, with the underlying software system. Its
rather frequent failures had to be understood in his case, for he was
programming, whereas I was only using it through an application; in
short, I was an end-user! These failures had to be understood not for
purposes of correction, but in order to find ways to avoid them. How
was the necessary insight to be obtained? I realized at this moment
that I had so far avoided this question; I had limited familiarization
with this novel system to the bare necessities which sufficed for the
task on my mind.

It soon became clear that a study of the system was nearly
impossible. Its dimensions were simply awesome, and documentation
accordingly sparse. Answers to questions that were momentarily
pressing could best be obtained by interviewing the system's
designers, who all were in-house. In doing so, we made the shocking
discovery that often we could not understand their
language. Explanations were fraught with jargon and references to
other parts of the system which had remained equally enigmatic to us.

So, our frustration-triggered breaks from compiler construction and
chip design became devoted to attempts to identify the essence, the
foundations of the system's novel aspects. What made it different from
conventional operating systems? Which of these concepts were
essential, which ones could be improved, simplified, or even
discarded? And where were they rooted? Could the system's essence be
distilled and extracted, like in a chemical process?

During the ensuing discussions, the idea emerged slowly to undertake
our own design. And suddenly it had become concrete. ``Crazy'' was my
first reaction, and ``impossible''. The sheer amount of work appeared as
overwhelming. After all, we both had to carry our share of teaching
duties back home. But the thought was implanted and continued to
occupy our minds.

Sometime thereafter, events back home suggested that I should take
over the important course about System Software. As it was the
unwritten rule that it should primarily deal with operating system
principles, I hesitated. My scruples were easily justified: After all
I had never designed such a system nor a part of it. And how can one
teach an engineering subject without first-hand experience?

Impossible? Had we not designed compilers, operating systems, and
document editors in small teams? And had I not repeatedly experienced
that an inadequate and frustrating program could be programmed from
scratch in a fraction of source code used by the original design? Our
brain-storming continued, with many intermissions, over several
weeks, and certain shapes of a system structure slowly emerged through
the haze. After some time, the preposterous decision was made: we
would embark on the design of an operating system for our workstation
(which happened to be much less powerful than the one used for my
rectangle-pushing) from scratch.

The primary goal, to personally obtain first-hand experience, and to
reach full understanding of every detail, inherently determined our
manpower: two part-time programmers. We tentatively set our time-limit
for completion to three years. As it later turned out, this had been a
good estimate; programming was begun in early 1986, and a first
version of the system was released in the fall of 1988.

Although the search for an appropriate name for a project is usually a
minor problem and often left to chance and whim of the designers, this
may be the place to recount how Oberon entered the picture in our
case. It happened that around the time of the beginning of our effort,
the space probe Voyager made headlines with a series of spectacular
pictures taken of the planet Uranus and of its moons, the largest of
which is named Oberon. Since its launch I had considered the Voyager
project as a singularly well-planned and successful endeavor, and as a
small tribute to it I picked the name of its latest object of
investigation. There are indeed very few engineering projects whose
products perform way beyond expectations and beyond their anticipated
lifetime; mostly they fail much earlier, particularly in the domain of
software. And, last but not least, we recall that Oberon is famous as
the king of elfs.

The consciously planned shortage of manpower enforced a single, but
healthy, guideline: Concentrate on essential functions and omit
embellishments that merely cater to established conventions and
passing tastes. Of course, the essential core had first to be
recognized and crystallized. But the basis had been laid. The ground
rule became even more crucial when we decided that the result should
be able to be used as teaching material. I remembered C.A.R. Hoare's
plea that books should be written presenting actually operational
systems rather than half-baked, abstract principles. He had
complained in the early 1970s that in our field engineers were told to
constantly create new artifacts without being given the chance to
study previous works that had proven their worth in the field. How
right was he, even to the present day!

The emerging goal to publish the result with all its details let the
choice of programming language appear in a new light: it became
crucial. Modula-2 which we had planned to use, appeared as not quite
satisfactory. Firstly, it lacked a facility to express extensibility
in an adequate way. And we had put extensibility among the principal
properties of the new system. By ``adequate'' we include
machine-independence. Our programs should be expressed in a manner
that makes no reference to machine peculiarities and low-level
programming facilities, perhaps with the exception of device
interfaces, where dependence is inherent.

Hence, Modula-2 was extended with a feature that is now known as type
extension. We also recognized that Modula-2 contained several
facilities that we would not need, that do not genuinely contribute to
its power of expression, but at the same time increase the complexity
of the compiler. But the compiler would not only have to be
implemented, but also to be described, studied, and understood. This
led to the decision to start from a clean slate also in the domain of
language design, and to apply the same principle to it: concentrate on
the essential, purge the rest. The new language, which still bears
much resemblance to Modula-2, was given the same name as the system:
Oberon\footnote{{\mc[1]}}{N. Wirth. The programming language Oberon. Software - Practice and Experience 18, 7, (July 1988) 671-690.}\footnote{{\mc[2]}}{M. Reiser and N. Wirth. Programming in Oberon - Steps beyond Pascal and Modula. Addison- Wesley, 1992.}
In contrast to its ancestor it is terser and, above
all, a significant step towards expressing programs on a high level of
abstraction without reference to machine-specific features.

We started designing the system in late fall 1985, and programming in
early 1986. As a vehicle we used our workstation Lilith and its
language Modula-2. First, a cross-compiler was developed, then
followed the modules of the inner core together with the necessary
testing and down-loading facilities. The development of the display
and the text system proceeded simultaneously, without the possibility
of testing, of course. We learned how the absence of a debugger, and
even more so the absence of a compiler, can contribute to careful
programming.

Thereafter followed the translation of the compiler into Oberon. This
was swiftly done, because the original had been written with
anticipation of the later translation. After its availability on the
target computer Ceres, together with the operability of the text
editing facility, the umbilical cord to Lilith could be cut off. The
Oberon System had become real, at least its draft version. This
happened around the middle of 1987; its description was published
thereafter\footnote{{\mc[3]}}{N. Wirth and J. Gutknecht. The Oberon System. Software - Practice and Experience, 19, 9 (Sept. 1989), 857-893.}, and a manual and guide followed in 1991\footnote{{\mc[5]}}{M. Reiser. The Oberon System - User Guide and Programmer's Manual. Addison-Wesley, 1991.}.

The system's completion took another year and concentrated on
connecting the workstations in a network for file transfer\footnote{{\mc[4]}}{N. Wirth. Ceres-Net: A low-cost computer network. Software - Practice and Experience, 20, 1 (Jan. 1990), 13-24.}, on a
central printing facility, and on maintenance tools. The goal of
completing the system within three years had been met. The system was
introduced in the middle of 1988 to a wider user community, and work
on applications could start. A service for electronic mail was
developed, a graphics system was added, and various efforts for
general document preparation systems proceeded. The display facility
was extended to accommodate two screens, including color. At the same
time, feedback from experience in its use was incorporated by
improving existing parts. Since 1989, Oberon has replaced Modula-2 in
our introductory programming courses.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 2: STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM.

\medskip

\beginsubsection 2.1. INTRODUCTION.

In order to warrant the sizeable effort of designing and constructing
an entire operating system from scratch, a number of basic concepts
need to be novel. % TODO: Maybe put an annotation about how this is stupid and is the reason why we have so much novel crap
We start this chapter with a discussion of the
principal concepts underlying the Oberon System and of the dominant
design decisions. On this basis, a presentation of the system's
structure follows. It will be restricted to its coarsest level, namely
the composition and interdependence of the largest building blocks,
the modules. The chapter ends with an overview of the remainder of the
book. It should help the reader to understand the role, place, and
significance of the parts described in the individual chapters.

The fundamental objective of an operating system is to present the
computer to the user and to the programmer at a certain level of
abstraction. For example, the store is presented in terms of
requestable pieces or variables of a specified data type, the disk is
presented in terms of sequences of characters (or bytes) called files,
the display is presented as rectangular areas called \emph{viewers}, the
keyboard is presented as an input stream of characters, and the mouse
appears as a pair of coordinates and a set of key states. Every
abstraction is characterized by certain properties and governed by a
set of operations. It is the task of the system to implement these
operations and to manage them, constrained by the available resources
of the underlying computer. This is commonly called \emph{resource management}.

Every abstraction inherently hides details, namely those from which it
abstracts. Hiding may occur at different levels. For example, the
computer may allow certain parts of the store, or certain devices to
be made inaccessible according to its mode of operation
(user/supervisor mode), or the programming language may make certain
parts inaccessible through a hiding facility inherent in its
visibility rules. The latter is of course much more flexible and
powerful, and the former indeed plays an almost negligible role in our
system. Hiding is important because it allows maintenance of certain
properties (called \emph{invariants}) of an abstraction to be
guaranteed. Abstraction is indeed the key of any modularization, and
without modularization every hope of being able to guarantee
reliability and correctness vanishes. Clearly, the Oberon System was
designed with the goal of establishing a modular structure on the
basis of purpose-oriented abstractions. The availability of an
appropriate programming language is an indispensable prerequisite, and
the importance of its choice cannot be over-emphasized.

\beginsubsection 2.2. CONCEPTS.

\beginsubsubsection 2.2.1. Viewers.

Whereas the abstractions of individual variables representing parts of
the primary store, and of files representing parts of the disk store
are well established notions and have significance in every computer
system, abstractions regarding input and output devices became
important with the advent of high interactivity between user and
computer. High interactivity requires high bandwidth, and the only
channel of human users with high bandwidth is the eye. Consequently,
the computer's visual output unit must be properly matched with the
human eye. This occurred with the advent of the high-resolution
display in the mid 1970s, which in turn had become feasible due to
faster and cheaper electronic memory components. The high-resolution
display marked one of the few very significant break-throughs in the
history of computer development. The typical bandwidth of a modern
display is in the order of 100 MHz. Primarily the high-resolution
display made visual output a subject of abstraction and resource management.
In the Oberon System, the display is partitioned into
\emph{viewers}, also called \emph{windows}, or more precisely, into \emph{frames},
rectangular areas of the screen(s). A viewer typically consists of two
frames, a title bar containing a subject name and a menu of commands,
and a main frame containing some text, graphic, picture, or other
object. A viewer itself is a frame; frames can be nested, in principle
to any depth.

The System provides routines for generating a frame (viewer), for
moving and for closing it. It allocates a new viewer at a specified
place, and upon request delivers hints as to where it might best be
placed. It keeps track of the set of opened viewers. This is what is
called \emph{viewer management}, in contrast to the handling of their
displayed contents.

But high interactivity requires not only a high bandwidth for visual
output, it demands also flexibility of input. Surely, there is no need
for an equally large bandwidth, but a keyboard limited by the speed of
typing to about 100 Hz is not good enough. The break-through on this
front was achieved by the so-called \emph{mouse}, a pointing device which
appeared roughly at the same time as the high-resolution display.

This was by no means just a lucky coincidence. The mouse comes to
fruition only through appropriate software and the high-resolution
display. It is itself a conceptually very simple device delivering
signals when moved on the table. These signals allow the computer to
update the position of a mark---the cursor---on the display. Since
feedback occurs through the human eye, no great precision is required
from the mouse. For example, when the user wishes to identify a
certain object on the screen, such as a letter, he moves the mouse as
long as required until the mapped cursor reaches the object.
This % TODO: Consider adding an annotation about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law
stands in marked contrast to a digitizer which is supposed to deliver
exact coordinates. The Oberon System relies very much on the
availability of a mouse.

Perhaps the cleverest idea was to equip mice with buttons. By being
able to signal a request with the same hand that determines the cursor
position, the user obtains the direct impression of issuing
position-dependent requests. Position-dependence is realized in
software by delegating interpretation of the signal to a procedure---a
so-called \emph{handler} or interpreter---which is local to the viewer in
whose area the cursor momentarily appears. A surprising flexibility of
command activation can be achieved in this manner by appropriate
software. Various techniques have emerged in this connection,
e.g. pop-up menus, pull-down-menus, etc. which are powerful even under
the presence of a single button only. For many applications, a mouse
with several keys is far superior, and the Oberon System basically
assumes three buttons to be available. The assignment of different
functions to the keys may of course easily lead to confusion when
every application prescribes different key assignment. This is,
however, easily avoided by the adherence to certain ``global''
conventions. In the Oberon System, the left button is primarily used
for \emph{marking} a position (setting a caret), the middle button for
issuing general \emph{commands} (see below), and the right button for
\emph{selecting} displayed objects.

Recently, it has become fashionable to use overlapping windows
mirroring documents being piled up on one's desk. We have found this
metaphor not entirely convincing. Partially hidden windows are
typically brought to the top and made fully visible before any
operation is applied to their contents. In contrast to the
insignificant advantage stands the substantial effort necessary to
implement this scheme. It is a good example of a case where the
benefit of a complication is incommensurate with its cost. Therefore,
we have chosen a solution that is much simpler to realize, yet has no
genuine disadvantages compared to overlapping windows: tiled viewers
as shown in Fig. 2.1.


\beginsubsubsection 2.2.2. Commands.

Position-dependent commands with fixed meaning (fixed
for each type of viewer) must be supplemented by general
commands. Conventionally, such commands are issued through the
keyboard by typing the program's name that is to be executed into a
special command text. In this respect, the Oberon System offers a
novel and much more flexible solution which is presented in the
following paragraphs.

First of all we remark that a program in the
common sense of a text compiled as a unit is mostly a far too large
unit of action to serve as a command. Compare it, for example, with
the insertion of a piece of text through a mouse command. In Oberon,
the notion of a unit of action is separated from the notion of unit of
compilation. The former is a \emph{command} represented by a (exported)
procedure, the latter is a \emph{module}. Hence, a module may, and typically
does, define several, even many commands. Such a (general) command may be invoked at any time by pointing at its name in any text visible in any viewer on the display, and by clicking the middle mouse button. The command name has the form \code{M.P}, where \code{P} is the procedure's identifier and \code{M} that of the module in which \code{P} is declared. As a consequence, any command click may cause the loading of one or several modules, if \code{M} is not already present in main store. The next invocation of \code{M.P} occurs instantaneously, since \code{M} is already loaded. A further consequence is that modules are never (automatically) removed, because a next command may well refer to the same module.

\figure{pdfs/image.46.rev.png}{4.7in}{2.1}{Oberon display with tiled viewers}

Every command has the purpose to alter the state of some
operands. Typically, they are denoted by text following the command
identification, and Oberon follows this convention. Strictly speaking,
commands are denoted as parameterless procedures; but the system
provides a way for the procedure to identify the text position of its
origin, and hence to read and interpret the text following the
command, i.e. the actual parameters. Both reading and interpretation
must, however, be programmed explicitly.

The parameter text must refer to objects that exist before command
execution starts and are quite likely the result of a previous command
interpretation. In most operating systems, these objects are \emph{files}
registered in the directory, and they act as interfaces between
commands. The Oberon System broadens this notion; the links between
consecutive commands are not restricted to files, but can be any
global variable, because modules do not disappear from storage after
command termination, as mentioned above.
% TODO: annotation how does this related to pipes in unix?

This tremendous flexibility seems to open Pandora's box, and indeed it
does when misused. The reason is that global variables' states may
completely determine and alter the effect of a command. The variables
represent \emph{hidden states}, hidden in the sense that the user is in
general unaware of them and has no easy way to determine their
value. The positive aspect of using global variables as interfaces
between commands is that some of them may well be visible on the
display. All viewers---and with them also their contents---are
organized in a data structure that is rooted in a global variable (in
module \code{Viewers}). Parts of this variable therefore constitute \emph{visible states},
and it is highly appropriate to refer to them as command
parameters.

One of the rules of what may be called the \emph{Oberon Programming Style} is
therefore to avoid hidden states, and to reduce the introduction of
global variables. We do not, however, raise this rule to the rank of a
dogma. There exist genuinely useful exceptions, even if the variables
have no visible parts.

There remains the question of how to denote visible objects as command
parameters. An obvious case is the use of the most recent selection as
parameter. A procedure for locating that selection is provided by
module \code{Oberon}. (It is restricted to text selections). Another
possibility is the use of the caret position in a text. This is used
in the case of inserting new text; the pressing of a key on the
keyboard is also considered to be a command, and it causes the
character's insertion at the caret position.

A special facility is introduced for designating viewers as operands:
the star marker. It is placed at the cursor position when the
keyboard's mark key (\code{SETUP}) is pressed. The procedure
\code{Oberon.MarkedViewer} identifies the viewer in whose area the star
lies. Commands which take it as their parameter are typically followed
by an asterisk in the text. Whether the text contained in a text
viewer, or a graph contained in a graphic viewer, or any other part of
the marked viewer is taken as the actual parameter depends on how the
command procedure is programmed.

Finally, a most welcome property of the system should not remain
unmentioned. It is a direct consequence of the persistent nature of
global variables and becomes manifest when a command fails. Detected
failures result in a trap. Such a trap should be regarded as an
abnormal command termination. In the worst case, global data may be
left in an inconsistent state, but they are not lost, and a next
command can be initiated based on their current state. A trap opens a
small viewer and lists the sequence of invoked procedures with their
local variables and current values. This information helps a
programmer to identify the cause of the trap.

\beginsubsubsection 2.2.3. Tasks.

From the presentations above it follows that the Oberon System is
distinguished by a highly flexible scheme of command activation. The
notion of a command extends from the insertion of a single character
and the setting of a marker to computations that may take hours or
days. It is moreover distinguished by a highly flexible notion of
operand selection not restricted to registered, named files. And most
importantly, by the virtual absence of hidden states. The state of the
system is practically determined by what is visible to the user.

This makes it unnecessary to remember a long history of previously
activated commands, started programs, entered modes, etc. Modes are in
our view the hallmark of user-unfriendly systems. It should at this
point have become obvious that the system allows a user to pursue
several different tasks concurrently. They are manifest in the form of
viewers containing texts, graphics, or other displayable objects. The
user switches between tasks implicitly when choosing a different
viewer as operand for the next command. The characteristic of this
concept is that task switching is under explicit control of the user,
and the atomic units of action are the commands.

At the same time, we classify Oberon as a single-process (or
single-thread) system. How is this apparent paradox to be understood?
Perhaps it is best explained by considering the basic mode of
operation. Unless engaged in the interpretation of a command, the
processor is engaged in a loop continuously polling event
sources. This loop is called the \emph{central loop}; it is contained in
module \code{Oberon} which may be regarded as the system's heart. The two
fixed event sources are the mouse and the keyboard. If a keyboard
event is sensed, control is dispatched to the handler installed in the
so-called \emph{focus viewer}, designated as the one holding the caret. If a
mouse event (key) is sensed, control is dispatched to the handler in
which the cursor currently lies. This is all possible under the
paradigm of a single, uninterruptible process.

The notion of a single process implies non-interruptability, and
therefore also that commands cannot interact with the
user. Interaction is confined to the selection of commands before
their execution. Hence, there exists no input statement in typical
Oberon programs. Inputs are given by parameters supplied and
designated before command invocation.

This scheme at first appears as gravely restrictive. In practice it is
not, if one considers single-user operation. It is this single user
who carries out a dialog with the computer. A human might be capable
of engaging in simultaneous dialogs with several processes only if the
commands issued are very time-consuming. We suggest that execution of
time-consuming computations might better be delegated to loosely
coupled compute-servers in a distributed system.

The primary advantage of a system dealing with a single process is
that task switches occur at user-defined points only, where no local
process state has to be preserved until resumption. Furthermore,
because the switches are user-chosen, the tasks cannot interfere in
unexpected and uncontrollable ways by accessing common variables. The
system designer can therefore omit all kinds of protection mechanisms
that exclude such interference. This is a significant simplification.

The essential difference between Oberon and multiprocess-systems is
that in the former task switches occur between commands only, whereas
in the latter a switch may be invoked after any single
instruction. Evidently, the difference is one of granularity of
action. Oberon's granularity is coarse, which is entirely acceptable
for a single-user system.

The system offers the possibility to insert further polling commands
in the central loop. This is necessary if additional event sources are
to be introduced. The prominent example is a network, where commands
may be sent from other workstations. The central loop scans a list of
so-called \emph{task descriptors}. Each descriptor refers to a command
procedure. The two standard events are selected only if their guard
permits, i.e. if either keyboard input is present, or if a mouse event
occurs. Inserted tasks must provide their own guard in the beginning
of the installed procedure.

The example of a network inserting commands, called \emph{requests}, raises a
question: what happens if the processor is engaged in the execution of
another command when the request arrives? Evidently, the request would
be lost unless measures are taken. The problem is easily remedied by
buffering the input. This is done in every driver of an input device,
in the keyboard driver as well as the network driver. The incoming
signal triggers an interrupt, and the invoked interrupt handler
accepts the input and buffers it. We emphasize that such interrupt
handling is confined to drivers, system components at the lowest
level. An interrupt does not evoke a task selection and a task
switch. Control simply returns to the point of interruption, and the
interrupt remains unnoticeable to programs. There exists, as with
every rule, an exception: an interrupt due to keyboard input of the
abort character returns control to the central loop.

\beginsubsubsection 2.2.4. Tool Texts as Configurable Menus.

Certainly, the concepts of viewers specifying their own interpretation
of mouse clicks, of commands invokable from any text on the display,
of any displayed object being selectable as an interface between
commands, and of commands being dialog-free, uninterruptible units of
action, have considerable influence on the style of programming in
Oberon, and they thoroughly change the style of using the
computer. The ease and flexibility in the way pieces of text can be
selected, moved, copied, and designated as command and as command
parameters, drastically reduces the need for typing. The mouse becomes
the dominant input device: the keyboard merely serves to input textual
data. This is accentuated by the use of so-called \emph{tool texts},
compositions of frequently used commands, which are typically
displayed in the narrower system track of viewers. One simply doesn't
type commands! They are usually visible somewhere already. Typically,
the user composes a tool text for every project pursued. Tool texts
can be regarded as individually configurable private menus.

The rarity of issuing commands by typing them has the most agreeable
benefit that their names can be meaningful words. For example, the
copy operation is denoted by \code{Copy} instead of \code{cp}, rename by \code{Rename}
instead of \code{rn}, the call for a file directory excerpt is named
\code{Directory} instead of \code{ls}. The need for memorizing an infinite list of
cryptic abbreviations, which is another hallmark of user-unfriendly
systems, vanishes.

But the influence of the Oberon concept is not restricted to the style
in which the computer is used. It extends also to the way programs are
designed to communicate with the environment. The definition of the
abstract type \code{Text} in the system's core suggests the replacement
of files by texts as carrier of input and output data in very many
cases. The advantage to be gained lies in the text's immediate
editability. For example, the output of the command \code{System.Directory}
produces the desired excerpt of the file directory
in the form of a (displayed) text. Parts of it or the whole may be
selected and copied into other texts by regular editing commands
(mouse clicks). Or, the compiler accepts texts as input. It is
therefore possible to compile a text, execute the program, and to
recompile the re-edited text without storing it on disk between
compilations and tests. The ubiquitous editability of text together
with the persistence of global data (in particular viewers) allows
many steps that do not contribute to the progress of the task actually
pursued to be avoided.

\beginsubsubsection 2.2.5. Extensibility.

An important objective in the design of the Oberon System was
extensibility. It should be easy to extend the system with new
facilities by adding modules that make use of the already existing
resources. Equally important, it should also reduce the system to
those facilities that are currently and actually used. For example, a
document editor processing documents free of graphics should not
require the loading of an extensive graphics editor, a workstation
operating as a stand-alone system should not require the loading of
extensive network software, and a system used for clerical purposes
need include neither compiler nor assembler. Also, a system
introducing a new kind of display frame should not include procedures
for managing viewers containing such frames. Instead, it should make
use of existing viewer management. The staggering consumption of
memory space by many widely used systems is due to violation of such
fundamental rules of engineering. The requirement of many megabytes of
store for an operating system is, albeit commonly tolerated, absurd
and another hallmark of user-unfriendliness, or perhaps manufacturer
friendliness. Its reason is none other than inadequate extensibility.

We do not restrict this notion to procedural extensibility, which is
easy to realize. The important point is that extensions may not only
add further procedures and functions, but introduce their own data
types built on the basis of those provided by the system: data
extensibility. For example, a graphics system should be able to define
its graphics frames based on frames provided by the basic display
module and by extending them with attributes appropriate for graphics.


This requires an adequate language feature. The language Oberon
provides precisely this facility in the form of \emph{type extensions}. The
language was designed for this reason; Modula-2 would have been the
choice, had it not been for the lack of a type extension feature. Its
influence on system structure was profound, and the results have been
most encouraging. In the meantime, many additions have been created
with surprising ease. One of them is described at the end of this
book. The basic system is nevertheless quite modest in its resource
requirements (see Table at the end of Section 2.3).

\beginsubsubsection 2.2.6. Dynamic Loading.

Activation of commands residing in modules that are not present in the
store implies the loading of the modules and, of course, all their
imports. Invoking the loader is, however, not restricted to command
activation; it may also occur through programmed procedure calls. This
facility is indispensable for a successful realization of genuine
extensibility. Modules must be loadable on demand. For example, a
document editor loads a graphics package when a graphic element
appears in the processed document, but not otherwise.

The Oberon System features no separate linker. A module is linked with
its imports when it is loaded, and never before. As a consequence,
every module is present only once, in main store (linked) as well as
on backing store (unlinked, as file). Avoiding the generation of
multiple copies in different, linked object files is the key to
storage economy. Prelinked mega-files do not occur in the Oberon
System, and every module is freely reusable.

% TODO: annotatation I think that this is a concequence of source code always being available and always part of one complete system rather than a bunch of different downloaded projects.

\beginsubsection 2.3. THE SYSTEM'S STRUCTURE.


The largest identifiable units of the system are its modules. It is
therefore most appropriate to describe a system's structure in terms
of its modules. As their interfaces are explicitly declared, it is
also easy to exhibit their interdependence in the form of a directed
graph. The edges indicate imports. The module graph of a system
programmed in Oberon is hierarchical, i.e. has no cycles. The lowest
members of the hierarchy effectively import hardware only. We refer
here to modules which contain device drivers. But module \code{Kernel} also
belongs to this class; it ``imports memory'' and includes the disk
driver. The modules on the top of the hierarchy effectively export to
the user. As the user has direct access to command procedures, we call
these top members \emph{command modules} or tool modules.

The hierarchy of the basic system is shown in a table of direct
imports and as a graph in Figure 2.2. The picture is simplified by
omitting direct import edges if an indirect path also leads from the
source to the destination. For example, \code{Files\/} imports \code{Kernel\/}; the
direct import is not shown, because a path from \code{Kernel\/} leads to \code{Files\/}
via \code{FileDir}.

\figure{pdfs/fig-2.2.png}{1.8in}{2.2}{The structure of the Oberon core}

Module names in the plural form typically indicate the definition of
an abstract data type in the module. The type is exported together
with the pertinent operations. Examples are \code{Files}, \code{Modules}, \code{Fonts}, \code{Texts}, \code{Viewers}, \code{MenuViewers}, and \code{TextFrames}. Modules whose names are in
singular form typically denote a resource that the module manages, be
it a global variable or a device. The variable or the device is itself
hidden (not exported) and becomes accessible through the module's
exported procedures. Examples are all device drivers, \code{Input}
for keyboard and mouse, \code{Kernel} for memory and disk, and \code{Display}. Exceptions are the command modules whose name is mostly
chosen according to the activity they primarily represent, like \code{System}, and \code{Edit\/}.

Module \code{Oberon} is, as already mentioned, the heart of the system
containing the central loop to which control returns after each
command interpretation, independent of whether it terminates normally
or abnormally. \code{Oberon} exports several procedures of auxiliary nature,
but primarily also the one allowing the invocation of commands (\code{Call})
and access to the command's parameter text through variable
\code{Oberon.Par}. Furthermore, it contains global, exported variables: the
log text. The log text typically serves to issue prompts and short
failure reports of commands. The text is displayed in a log viewer
that is automatically opened when module \code{System} is initialized. Module
\code{Oberon} furthermore contains the two markers used globally on the
display, the \emph{mouse cursor} and the \emph{star pointer}. It exports procedures
to draw and to erase them, and allows the installation of different
patterns for them.

The system shown in Fig. 2.2. basically contains facilities for
generating and editing texts, and for storing them in the file
system. All other functions are performed by modules that must be
added in the usual way by module loading on demand. This includes,
notably, the compiler, network communication, document editors, and
all sorts of programs designed by users. The high priority given in
the system's conception to modularity, to avoiding unnecessary frills,
and to concentrate on the indispensable in the core, has resulted in a
system of remarkable compactness. Although this property may be
regarded as of little importance in this era of falling costs of large
memories, we consider it to be highly essential. We merely should like
to draw the reader's attention to the correlation between a systems'
size and its reliability. Also, we do not consider it as good
engineering practice to consume a resource lavishly just because it
happens to be cheap. The following table lists the core's modules and
the major application modules, and it indicates the size of code (in
words) and static variables (in bytes) and, the number of source
program lines.

\beginsubsection 2.4. A TOUR THROUGH THE CHAPTERS.

Implementation of a system proceeds bottom-up. Naturally, because
modules on higher levels are clients of those on the lower levels and
cannot function without the availability of their imports. Description
of a system, on the other hand, is better ordered in the top-down
direction. This is because a system is designed with its expected
applications and functions in mind. Decomposition into a hierarchy of
modules is justified by the use of auxiliary functions and
abstractions and by postponing their more detailed explanation to a
later time when their need has been fully motivated. For this reason,
we will proceed essentially in the top-down direction.

Chapters 3--5 describe the outer core of the system. Chapter 3
focusses on the dynamic aspects. In particular, this chapter
introduces the fundamental operational units of \emph{task} and
\emph{command}. Oberon's tasking model distinguishes the categories of
\emph{interactive tasks} and \emph{background tasks}. Interactive tasks are
represented on the display screen by rectangular areas, so-called
\emph{viewers}. Background tasks need not be connected with any displayed
object. They are scheduled with low priority when interactions are
absent. A good example of a background task is the memory garbage
collector. Both interactive tasks and background tasks are mapped to a
single process by the task scheduler. Commands in Oberon are explicit,
atomic units of interactive operations. They are realized in the form
of exported parameterless procedures and replace the heavier-weight
notion of program known from more conventional operating systems. This
chapter continues with a definition of a software toolbox as a
logically connected collection of commands. It terminates with an
outline of the system control toolbox.


Chapter 4 explains Oberon's display system. It starts with a
discussion of our choice of a hierarchical tiling strategy for the
allocation of viewers. A detailed study of the exact role of Oberon
viewers follows. Type \code{Viewer\/} is presented as an object class
with an open message interface providing a conceptual basis for far-reaching
extensibility. Viewers are then recognized as just a special case of
so-called \emph{frames} that may be nested. A category of standard viewers
containing a menu frame and a frame of contents is investigated. The
next topic is cursor handling. A cursor in Oberon is a marked
path. Both viewer manager and cursor handler operate on an abstract
logical display area rather than on individual physical monitors. This
allows a unified handling of display requests, independent of number
and types of monitors assigned. For example, smooth transitions of the
cursor across screen boundaries are conceptually guaranteed. The
chapter continues with the presentation of a concise and complete set
of raster operations that is used to place textual and graphical
elements in the display area. An overview of the system display
toolbox concludes the chapter.

Chapter 5 introduces text. Oberon distinguishes itself by treating
\code{Text} as an abstract data type that is integrated in the central
system. Numerous fundamental consequences are discussed. For example,
a text can be produced by one command, edited by a user, and then
consumed by a next command. Commands themselves can be represented
textually in the form \code{M.P}, followed by a textual parameter
list. Consequently, any command can be called directly from within a
text (so-called \emph{tool}) simply by pointing at it with the
mouse. However, the core of this chapter is a presentation of Oberon's
text system as a case study in program modularization. The concerns of
managing a text and displaying it are nicely separated. Both the text
manager and the text display feature an abstract public interface as
well as an internally hidden data structure. Finally in this chapter,
Oberon's type-font management and the toolbox for editing are
discussed.

Chapters 6--9 describe the \emph{inner core}, still in a top-down
path. Chapter~6 explains the loader of program modules and motivates
the introduction of the data type \code{Module\/}. The chapter includes the
management of the memory part holding program code and defines the
format in which compiled modules are stored as object
files. Furthermore, it discusses the problems of binding separately
compiled modules together and of referencing objects defined in other
modules.

Chapter 7 is devoted to the file system, a part of crucial importance,
because files are involved in almost every program and
computation. The chapter consist of two distinct parts, the first
introducing the type \code{File\/} and describing the structure of files,
i.e. their representation on disk storage with its sequential
characteristics, the second describing the directory of file names and
its organisation as a \btree for obtaining fast searches.

The management of memory is the subject of Chapter 8. A single,
central storage management was one of the key design decisions,
guaranteeing an efficient and economical use of storage. The chapter
explains the store's partitioning into specific areas. Its central
concern, however, is the discussion of dynamic storage management in
the partition called the \emph{heap}. The algorithm for allocation
(corresponding to the intrinsic procedure \code{NEW\/}) and for retrieval
(called garbage collection) are explained in detail.

At the lowest level of the module hierarchy we find device
drivers. They are described in Chapter 9, which contains drivers for
some widely accepted interface standards. The first is \ps2, a serial
transmission with synchronous clock. This is used for the keyboard and
for the mouse. The second is \acro{SPI}, a standard for bi-directional,
serial transmission with synchronous clock. This is used for the
``disk'', represented by an \sdcard (flash memory), and for the
network. And the third standard is \rs232 typically used for simple
and slow data links. It is bidirectional and asynchronous.

The second part of the book, consisting of Chapters 10--15, is
devoted to what may be called first applications of the basic Oberon
System. These chapters are therefore independent of each other, making
reference to Chapters 3--9 only.

Although the Oberon System is well-suited for operating stand-alone
workstations, a facility for connecting a set of computers should be
considered as fundamental. Module \code{Net\/}, which makes transmission of
files among workstations connected by a bus-like network possible, is
the subject of Chapter 10. It presents not only the problems of
network access, of transmission failures and collisions, but also
those of naming partners. The solutions are implemented in a
surprisingly compact module which uses a network driver presented in
Chapter 9.

When a set of workstations is connected in a network, the desire for a
central server appears. A central facility serving as a file
distribution service, as a printing station, and as a storage for
electronic mail is presented in Chapter 11. It emerges by extending
the \code{Net\/} module of Chapter 10, and is a convincing application of the
tasking facilities explained in Section 2.2. In passing we note that
the server operates on a machine that is not under observation by a
user. This circumstance requires an increased degree of robustness,
not only against transmission failures, but also against data that do
not conform to defined formats.

The presented system of servers demonstrates that Oberon's
single-thread scheme need not be restricted to single-user
systems. The fact that every command or request, once accepted, is
processed until completion, is acceptable if the request does not
occupy the processor for too long, which is mostly the case in the
presented server applications. Requests arriving when the processor is
engaged are queued. Hence, the processor handles requests one at a
time instead of interleaving them which, in general, results in faster
overall performance due to the absence of frequent task switching.

Chapter 12 describes the Oberon compiler. It translates source text in
Oberon into target code, i.e. instruction sequences of some target
computer. Its principles and techniques are explained in \footnote{{\mc[6]}}{N. Wirth. Compiler Construction. Addison-Wesley, Reading, 1996. ISBN 0-201-40353-6}. Both,
source language and target architecture must be understood before
studying a compiler. Both source language and the target computer's
\RISC architecture are presented in the Appendix.

Although here the compiler appears as an application module, it
naturally plays a distinguished role, because the system (and the
compiler itself) is formulated in the language which the compiler
translates into code. Together with the text editor it was the
principal tool in the system's development. The use of
straight-forward algorithms for parsing and symbol table organization
led to a reasonably compact piece of software. A main contributor to
this result is the language's definition: the language is devoid of
complicated structures and rarely used embellishments.

The compiler and thereby the chapter is partitioned into two main
parts. The first is language-specific, but does not refer to any
particular target computer. It consist of the \emph{scanner} and the
\emph{parser}. This part is therefore of most general interest to the
readership. The second part is, essentially, language-independent, but
is specifically tailored to the instruction set of the target
computer. It is called the \emph{code generator}.

Texts play a predominant role in the Oberon System. Their preparation
is supported by the system's major tool, the editor. In Chapter 13 we
describe another editor, one that handles graphic objects. At first,
only horizontal and vertical lines and short captions are introduced
as objects. The major difference to texts lies in the fact that their
coordinates in the drawing plane do not follow from those of their
predecessor automatically, because they form a set rather than a
sequence. Each object carries its own, independent coordinates. The
influence of this seemingly small difference upon an editor are
far-reaching and permeate the entire design. There exist hardly any
similarities between a text and a graphics editor. Perhaps one should
be mentioned: the partitioning into three parts. The bottom module
defines the respective abstract data structure for texts or graphics,
together with, of course, the procedures handling the structure, such
as searches, insertions, and deletions. The middle module in the
hierarchy defines a respective frame and contains all procedures
concerned with displaying the respective objects including the frame
handler defining interpretation of mouse and keyboard events. The top
modules are the respective tool modules (\code{Edit\/}, \code{Draw\/}). The presented
graphics editor is particularly interesting in so far as it
constitutes a convincing example of Oberon's extensibility. The
graphics editor is integrated into the entire system; it embeds its
graphic frames into menu-viewers and uses the facilities of the text
system for its caption elements. And lastly, new kinds of elements can
be incorporated by the mere addition of new modules, i.e. without
expanding, even without recompiling the existing ones. Two examples
are shown in Chapter 13 itself: rectangles and circles.

The Draw System has been extensively used for the preparation of
diagrams of electronic circuits. This application suggests a concept
that is useful elsewhere too, namely a recursive definition of the
notion of object. A set of objects may be regarded as an object itself
and be given a name. Such an object is called a \emph{macro}. It is a
challenge to the designer to implement a macro facility such that it
is also extensible, i.e. in no way refers to the type of its elements,
not even in its input operations of files on which macros are stored.

Chapter 14 presents two other tools, namely one used for installing an
Oberon System on a bare machine, and one used to recover from failures
of the file store. Although rarely employed, the first was
indispensable for the development of the system. The maintenance or
recovery tools are invaluable assets when failures occur. And they do!
Chapter 14 covers material that is rarely presented in the literature.

Chapter 15 is devoted to tools that are not used by the Oberon System
presented so far, but may be essential in some applications. The first
is a data link with a protocol based on the \rs232 standard shown in
Chapter 9. Another is a standard set of basic mathematical
functions. And the third is a tool for creating new macros for the
Draw System.

The third part of this book is devoted to a detailed description of
the hardware. Chapter 16 defines the processor, for which the compiler
generates code. The target computer is a truly simple and regular
processor called \RISC with only 14 instructions, represented not by a
commercial processor, but implemented with an \acro{FPGA}, a Field
Programmable Gate Array. It allows its structure to be described in
full detail. It is a straight-forward, von Neumann type device
consisting of a register bank, an arithmetic-logic unit, including a
floating-point unit. Typical optimization facilities, like pipelining
and cache memory, have been omitted for the sake of transparency and
simplicity. The processor circuit is described in the language
\emph{Verilog}.

Chapter 17 describes the environment in which the processor is
embedded. This environment consists of the interfaces to main memory
and to all external devices.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 3: THE TASKING SYSTEM.

Eventually, it is the generic ability to perform every conceivable
task that turns a computing device into a versatile universal
tool. Consequently, the issues of modeling and orchestrating of tasks
are fundamental in the design of any operating system. Of course, we
cannot expect a single fixed tasking metaphor to be the ideal solution
for all possible kinds of systems and modes of use. For example,
different metaphors are probably appropriate in the cases of a closed
mainframe system serving a large set of users in time-sharing mode on
the one hand, and of a personal workstation that is operated by a
single user at a high degree of interactivity on the other hand.

In the case of Oberon, we have consciously concentrated on the domain
of personal workstations. More precisely, we have directed Oberon's
tasking facilities towards a single-user interactive personal
workstation that is possibly integrated into a local area network.

We start the presentation in Section 3.1 with a clarification of the
technical notion of task. In Section 3.2, we continue with a detailed
explanation of the scheduling strategy. Then, in Section 3.3, we
introduce the concept of \emph{command}. And finally, Section 3.4 provides an
overview of predefined system-oriented toolboxes, i.e. coherent
collections of commands devoted to some specific topic. Example topics
are system control and diagnosis, display management, and file
management.

\beginsubsection 3.1. THE CONCEPT OF TASK.

In principle, we distinguish two categories of tasks in Oberon: \emph{Interactive tasks} and \emph{background tasks}. Loosely speaking,
interactive tasks are bound to local regions on the display screen and
to interactions with their contents while, in contrast, background
tasks are system-wide and not necessarily related to any specific
displayed entity.

\beginsubsubsection 3.1.1. Interactive tasks.

Every interactive task is represented by a so-called \emph{viewer}. Viewers
constitute the interface to Oberon's display-system. They embody a
variety of roles that are collected in an abstract data type
\code{Viewer\/}. We shall give a deeper insight into the display system in
Chapter 4. For the moment it suffices to know that viewers are
represented graphically as rectangles on the display screen and that
they are implicit carriers of interactive tasks. 
% TODO: Figure 3.1 shows a typical Oberon display screen that is divided up into seven viewers corresponding to seven simultaneously active interactive tasks. Figure 3.1 Typical Oberon display configuration with tool track on the right


In order to get firmer ground under our feet, we now present the programmed declaration of type \code{Viewer\/} in a slightly abstracted form:
\begintt
Viewer = POINTER TO ViewerDesc;
ViewerDesc = RECORD
  X, Y, W, H: INTEGER;
  handle: Handler;
  state: INTEGER;
END;
\endtt

\noindent \code{X\/}, \code{Y\/}, \code{W\/}, \code{H\/} define the viewer's rectangle on the screen, i.e. location
\code{X\/}, \code{Y\/} of the lower left corner relative to the display origin, width \code{W\/}
and height \code{H\/}. The variable \code{state\/} informs about the current state of
visibility (visible, closed, covered), while \code{handle\/} represents the
functional interface of viewers. The type of the handler is
\begintt
Handler = PROCEDURE (V: Viewer; VAR M: ViewerMsg);
\endtt

\noindent where \code{ViewerMsg} is some base type of messages whose exact declaration is of minor importance for the moment:
\begintt
ViewerMsg = RECORD ... (*basic parameter fields*) END;
\endtt

\noindent However, we should point out the use of object-oriented
terminology. It is justified because \code{handle\/} is a procedure variable (a
\emph{handler}) whose identity depends on the specific viewer. A call
\code{V.handle(V, M)} can therefore be interpreted as the sending of a
message \code{M\/} to be handled by the method of the receiving viewer \code{V\/}.

We recognize an important difference between the standard
object-oriented model and our handler paradigm. The standard model is
\emph{closed} in the sense that only a fixed set of messages is understood by
a given class of objects. In contrast, the handler paradigm is \emph{open}
because it defines just the root (\code{ViewerMsg\/}) of a potentially
unlimited tree of extending message types. For example, a concrete
handler might be able to handle messages of type \code{MyViewerMsg\/}, where
\begintt
MyViewerMsg = RECORD (ViewerMsg)
  mypar: MyParameters
END;
\endtt

\noindent is an extended type of \code{ViewerMsg\/}.

It is worth noting that our open object-oriented model is extremely
flexible. Notably, extending the set of message types that are handled
by an object is a mere implementation issue, that is, it has no effect
at all on the object’s compile-time interface and on the system
integrity. It is fair to mention though that such a high degree of
extensibility does not come for free. The price to pay is the
obligation of explicit message \emph{dispatching at runtime}. The following
chapters will capitalize on this property.

Coming back to the perspective of tasks, we note that each sending of
a message to a viewer corresponds to an activation or reactivation of
the interactive task that it represents.

\beginsubsubsection 3.1.2. Background Tasks.

Oberon background tasks are not connected a priori with any specific
aggregate in the system. Seen technically, they are instances of an
abstract data type consisting of type declarations \code{Task} and \code{TaskDesc}
together with intrinsic operations \code{NewTask}, \code{Install} and \code{Remove}:
\begintt
Task = POINTER TO TaskDesc;
TaskDesc = RECORD state: INTEGER; handle: PROCEDURE END;

PROCEDURE NewTask(h: PROCEDURE; period: INTEGER): Task;
PROCEDURE Install (T: Task);
PROCEDURE Remove (T: Task);
\endtt

\noindent The procedures \code{Install\/} and \code{Remove\/} are called explicitly in order to
transfer the state of the specified task from \emph{offline\/} to \emph{idle\/} and from
\emph{idle\/} to \emph{offline\/} respectively. Installed tasks take their turns in
becoming \emph{active\/}, that is, in being executed. The installed handlers
are simple, parameterless procedures specifying their own actions and
conditions for execution, with one exception: Resumption may be
delayed until a certain period of time has elapsed. This period is
specified in milliseconds when a task is created.

The following two examples of concrete background tasks may serve a
better understanding of our explanations. The first one is a
system-wide garbage collector collecting unused memory. The second
example is a network monitor accepting incoming data on a local area
network. In both examples the state of the task is captured entirely
by global system variables. We shall come back to these topics in
Chapters 8 and 10 respectively.

We should not end this Section without drawing an important
conclusion. Transfers of control between tasks are implemented in
Oberon as ordinary calls and returns of ordinary procedures (procedure
variables, actually). Preemption is not possible. From that we
conclude that active periods of tasks are sequentially ordered and can
be controlled by a single thread of control. This simplification pays
well: Locks of common resources are completely dispensable and
deadlocks are not a topic.

\beginsubsection 3.2. THE TASK SCHEDULER.

We start from the general assumption that, at any given time, a number
of well-determined tasks are ready in the system to be
serviced. Remember that two categories of tasks exist: Interactive
tasks and background tasks. They differ substantially in the criteria
of activation or reactivation and in the priority of
dispatching. Interactive tasks are (re)activated exclusively upon
interactions by the user and are dispatched with high priority. In
contrast, background tasks are polled with low priority.

We already know that interactive tasks are activated by sending messages. The types of messages used for this purpose are \code{InputMsg\/} and \code{ControlMsg\/} reporting keyboard events and mouse events respectively. Slightly simplified, they are declared as
\begintt
InputMsg = RECORD (ViewerMsg)
  id: INTEGER;
  X, Y: INTEGER;
  keys: SET;
  ch: CHAR
END;

ControlMsg = RECORD (ViewerMsg)
  id: INTEGER;
  X, Y: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent The field \code{id} specifies the exact request transmitted with this
specific reactivation. In the case of \code{InputMsg} the possible
requests are \emph{consume} (the character specified by field \code{ch}) and \emph{track} (mouse, starting from state given by keys and \code{X}, \code{Y}). In case of \code{ControlMsg} the choice is mark (the viewer
at position \code{X}, \code{Y}) or \emph{neutralize}. Mark means moving the
global system pointer (typically represented as a star-shaped mark) to
the current position of the mouse. Neutralizing a viewer is equivalent
to removing all marks and graphical attributes from this viewer.

All tasking facilities are collected in one program module, called
\code{Oberon}. In particular, the module's definition exposes the
declarations of the abstract data type \code{Task} and of the message types
\code{InputMsg} and \code{ControlMsg}. The module's most important contribution,
however, is the task scheduler (often referred to as ``Oberon loop'')
that can be regarded as the system's dynamic center.

Before studying the scheduler in detail we need some more
preparation. We start with the institution of the \emph{focus viewer}. By
definition, this is a distinguished viewer that by convention consumes
subsequent keyboard input. Note that we identify the focus viewer with
the focus task, hereby making use of the one-to-one correspondence
between viewers and tasks.

Module \code{Oberon} provides the following facilities in connection with the
focus viewer: A global variable \code{FocusViewer}, a procedure \code{PassFocus} for
transferring the role of focus to a new viewer, and a defocus variant
of \code{ControlMsg} for notifying the old focus viewer of such a transfer.

The implementation details of the abstract data type \code{Task} are hidden
from the clients. It is sufficient to know that all task descriptors
are organized in a ring and that a pointer points to the previously
activated task. The ring is guaranteed never to be empty because the
above mentioned garbage collector is installed as a permanent sentinel
task at system loading time. % See Knuth TAOCP about circular lists and sentinels

The following is a slightly abstracted version of the actual scheduler
code operating on the task ring. It should be associated with
procedure \code{Loop} in the module \code{Oberon}.
% CODE-3.2/Scheduler
\begintt
get mouse position and state of keys;
REPEAT
  IF keyboard input available THEN read character
    IF character is escape THEN
      broadcast neutralize message to viewers
    ELSIF character is mark THEN
      send mark message to viewer containing mouse
    ELSE send consume message to focus viewer
    END;
    get mouse position and state of keys
  ELSIF at least one key pressed THEN
    REPEAT
      send track message to viewer containing mouse;
      get mouse position and state of keys
    UNTIL all keys released
  ELSE (*no key pressed*)
    send track message to viewer containing mouse;
    take next task in ring as current task;
    call its handler (if specified time period has elapsed)
    get mouse position and state of keys
  END
UNTIL FALSE
\endtt

\noindent The system executes a sequence of uninterrupted procedures
(tasks). Interactive tasks are triggered by input data being present,
either from the keyboard, the mouse, or other input
sources. Background tasks are taken up in a round-robin
manner. Interactive tasks have priority.

Having consciously excluded exceptional program behavior in our
explanations so far, some comments about the way of runtime
continuation in the case of a failing task or, in other words, in the
case of a \emph{trap} are in order here. On the (abstract) level of tasks, we
can identify three sequential actions of recovery taken after a
program failure: % TODO: This pseudocode should be roman or italics inside \langle \rangle like WEB
\begintt
rm recovery after program failure =
BEGIN
  save current system state;
  call installed trap handler;
  roll back to start of task scheduler;
END
\endtt

\noindent Essentially, the system state is determined by the values of all
global and local variables at a given time. The trap handler typically
opens an extra viewer displaying the cause of the trap and the saved
system state. Notice in the program fragment above that background
tasks are removed from the ring after failing. This is an effective
precaution against cascades of repeated failures. Obviously, no such
precaution is necessary in the case of interactive tasks because their
reactivation is under control of the user of the system.

Summarizing the essence of the tasking system: Oberon is a
multitasking system based on a two-category model. Interactive tasks
are interfacing with the display system and are scheduled with high
priority upon user interactions. Background tasks are stand-alone and
are scheduled with low priority. Task activations are modeled as
message passing and eventually as calls of procedures assigned to
variables. They are sequentially ordered and controlled by a single
thread of control.

\beginsubsection 3.3. THE CONCEPT OF COMMAND.

An operating system constitutes a general purpose platform on which
application software packages can build upon. To software designers
the platform appears as interface to ``the system'' and (in particular)
to the underlying hardware. Unfortunately, interfaces defined by
conventional operating systems often suffer from an all too primitive
access mechanism that is based solely on the concept of ``software interrupt''
or ``supervisor call'' and on files taking the role of
``connecting pipes''. The situation is especially ironic when compared
with the development of high-level programming languages towards
extreme abstraction.

We have put greatest emphasis in Oberon on closing the \emph{semantic gap}
between application software packages and the system platform. The
result of our efforts is a highly expressive and consistent
\emph{application programming interface} (\acro{API}) in the form of an explicit
hierarchy of module definitions. Perhaps the most significant and most
notable outcome of this approach is a collection of very powerful and
system-wide abstract data types like
\code{Task\/}, \code{Frame\/}, \code{Viewer\/}, \code{File\/}, \code{Font\/},
\code{Text\/}, \code{Module\/}, \code{Reader\/}, \code{Scanner\/}, \code{Writer\/} etc..

\beginsubsubsection 3.3.1. Atomic actions.

The most important generic function of any operating system is
executing \emph{programs}. A clarification of the term \emph{program} as it is used
in Oberon comprises two views: a \emph{static} one and a \emph{dynamic}
one. Statically, an Oberon program is simply a package of software
together with an entry point. More formally, an Oberon program is a
pair \code{(M*, P)}, where \code{M} is an arbitrary module, \code{P} is an exported
parameterless procedure of \code{M}, and \code{M*} denotes the hierarchy consisting
of \code{M} itself and of all directly and indirectly imported modules. Note
that two hierarchies \code{M*} and \code{N*} are not generally disjoint, even if \code{M}
and \code{N} are different modules. Rather, their intersection is a superset
of the operating system.

Viewed dynamically, an Oberon program is defined as an atomic action
(often called \emph{command}) operating on the global system state, where
\emph{atomic} means ``without user interaction''. This definition is just a
necessary consequence of our model of non-preemptive task scheduling
with the benefit of a single carrier thread. We can argue like this:
When a traditional interactive program requires input from the user,
the current task is normally preempted in favor of another task that
produces the required input data. Therefore, a traditional interactive
program can be viewed as a sequence of atomic actions interrupted by
actions that possibly belong to other programs. Whereas in traditional
systems these interruptions may occur at any time, in Oberon they can
occur only after the completion of a task, of a command.

Quintessentially, Oberon programs are represented in the form of
\emph{commands} that are in the form of exported parameterless procedures
that do not interact with the user of the system.

Returning to the calling and execution of programs we now arrive at
the following refined code version:
\begintt
call program (M*, P) = BEGIN
  load module hierarchy M*; call command P
END
\endtt

\noindent The system interface to the command mechanism itself is again provided
by module \code{Oberon}. Its primary operation can be paraphrased as
``call a command by its name and pass a list of actual parameters'':
\begintt
PROCEDURE Call (name: ARRAY OF CHAR; par: ParList;
                VAR res: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent \code{name} is the name of the desired command in the form \code{M.P}, \code{par} is the
list of actual parameters, and \code{res} is a result code. But in fact we
have separated the setting of parameters from the actual
call. Parameters are set by calling
\begintt
PROCEDURE SetPar (F: Display.Frame; T: Texts.Text;
                  pos: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent and the actual call is achieved by calling
\begintt
PROCEDURE Call (name: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent The pair \code{(T, pos)} specifies the starting position of a textual
parameter list. \code{F} indicates the calling viewer. Notice the occurrence
of yet another abstract data type of name \code{Text} that is exported by
module \code{Texts}. We shall devote Chapter 5 to a thorough discussion of
Oberon's text system. For the moment we can simply look at a text as a
sequence of characters.

The list of actual parameters is handed over to the called command by
module \code{Oberon} in the form of an exported global variable \code{Par}:
\begintt
Par: RECORD vwr: Viewers.Viewer;
       frame: Display.Frame;
       text: Texts.Text;
       pos: INTEGER
     END
\endtt
In principle, commands operate on the entire system and can access the
current global state via the system's powerful abstract modular
interface, of which the list of actual parameters is just one
component. Another one is the so-called \emph{system log} which is a
system-wide protocol reporting on the progress of command execution
and on exceptional events in chronological order. The log is
represented as a global variable of type \code{Text}:
\begintt
Log: Texts.Text;
\endtt

\noindent It should have become clear by now that implementers of commands may
rely on a rich arsenal of abstract global facilities that reflect the
current system state and make it accessible. In other words, they may
rely on a high degree of system integration. Therefore, Oberon
features an extraordinarily broad spectrum of mutually integrated
facilities. For example, the system distinguishes itself by a complete
integration of the abstract data types \code{Viewer} and \code{Text} that we
encountered above. They will be the subject of Chapters 4 and 5.

Module \code{Oberon} assists the integration of these types with the
following conceptual features, of which the first two are familiar to
us already: Standard parameter list for commands, system log, generic
text selection, and generic copy viewer. At this point we should add a
word of clarification to our use of the term ``generic''. It is
synonymous with ``interpretable individually by any viewer (interactive task)''
and is typically used in connection with messages or orders
whose receiver's exact identity is unknown.

Let us now go into a brief discussion of the generic facilities
without, however, leaving the level of our current abstraction and
understanding.

\beginsubsubsection 3.3.2. Generic text selection.

Textual selections are characterized by a text, a stretch of
characters within that text, and a time stamp. Without further
qualification ``the text selection'' always means ``the most recent text selection''.
It can be obtained programmatically by calling procedure GetSelection:
\begintt
PROCEDURE GetSelection (VAR text: Texts.Text;
                        VAR beg, end, time: LONGINT);
\endtt

\noindent The parameters specify the desired stretch of text starting
at position \code{beg} and ending at \code{end - 1} as well as the associated time
stamp. The procedure is implemented in form of a broadcast of a so-called
selection message to all viewers. The declaration of this
message is
\begintt
SelectionMsg = RECORD (ViewerMsg)
  time: INTEGER;
  text: Texts.Text;
  beg, end: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\beginsubsubsection 3.3.3. Generic copy viewer.

Generic copying is synonymous with reproducing and cloning. It is the
most elementary generic operation possible. Again, a variant of type
\code{ViewerMsg} is used for the purpose of transmitting requests of the
desired type:
\begintt
CopyMsg = RECORD (ViewerMsg) vwr: Viewers.Viewer END
\endtt 

\noindent Receivers of a \emph{copy} message typically generate a clone of
themselves and return it to the sender via field \code{vwr}.

Let us now summarize this Section: Oberon is an operating system that
presents itself to its clients in the form of a highly expressive
abstract modular interface that exports many powerful abstract data
types like, for example, \code{Viewer} and \code{Text}. A rich arsenal of global
data types and generic facilities serve the purpose of system
integration at a high degree. Programs in Oberon are modeled as
so-called commands, i.e. as exported parameterless procedures that do
not interact with the user. The collection of commands provided by a
module appears as its user interface. Parameters are passed to
commands via a global parameter list, registered by the calling task
in the central module \code{Oberon}. Commands operate on the global state of
the system.

\beginsubsection 3.4. TOOLBOXES.

Modules typically appear in three different forms. The first is a
module that encapsulates some data, letting them be accessed only
through exported procedures and functions. A good example is module
\code{FileDir}, encapsulating the file directory and protecting it from
disruptive access. A second kind is the module representing an
\emph{abstract data type}, exporting a type and its associated
operators. Typical examples are modules \code{Files}, \code{Modules}, \code{Viewers}, and
\code{Texts}. A third kind is the collection of procedures pertaining to the
same topic, such as module \code{RS-232} handling communication over a serial
line.

Oberon adds a fourth form: the \emph{toolbox}. By definition, this is a pure
collection of commands in the sense of the previous section. Toolboxes
distinguish themselves principally from the other forms of modules by
the fact that they lie on top of the modular hierarchy. Toolbox
modules are ``imported'' by system users at run-time. In other words,
their definitions define the user interface. Typical examples are
modules \code{System\/} and \code{Edit\/}. As a rule of thumb there exists a toolbox for
every topic or application.

As an example of a toolbox definition we quote an annotated version of
module \code{System\/}:
\begintt
DEFINITION System;

(*System management, Chapters 3 and 8*)
  PROCEDURE SetUser; (*identification*)
  PROCEDURE SetFont; (*for typed text*)
  PROCEDURE SetColor; (*for typed text and graphics*)
  PROCEDURE SetOffset; (*for typed text*)
  PROCEDURE Date; (*set or display time and date*)
  PROCEDURE Collect; (*garbage*)
  
(*Display management, Chapter 4*)
  PROCEDURE Open; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Close; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE CloseTrack;
  PROCEDURE Recall; (*most recently closed viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Copy; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Grow; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Clear; (*clear log*)
  
(*Module management, Chapter 6*)
  PROCEDURE Free; (*specified modules*)
  PROCEDURE ShowCommands; (*of specified module*)
  PROCEDURE ShowModules; (*list loaded modules*)
  
(*File management, Chapter 7*)
  PROCEDURE Directory;
  PROCEDURE CopyFiles;
  PROCEDURE RenameFiles;
  PROCEDURE DeleteFiles;)
  
(*System inspection, Chapter 8*)
  PROCEDURE Watch; (*tasks, memory and disk storage*)
END System;
\endtt

\noindent An important consequence of our integrated systems approach is the
possibility of constructing a universal, interactive 
\emph{command interpreter} bound to viewers of \emph{textual contents}. If the text obeys
the following syntax (specified in Extended Backus-Naur Form \acro{EBNF}), we
call it \emph{command tool}:
\begintt
CommandTool = { [Comment] CommandName [ParameterList] }.
\endtt

\noindent If present, the parameter list is made available to the called command via fields \code{text} and \code{pos} in the global variable \code{Par} that is exported from module \code{Oberon\/}. Because this parameter list is interpreted individually by each command, its format is completely open. However, we postulate some conventions and rules for the purpose of a standardized user interface:

\item{1.} The elements of a textual parameter list are universal syntactical tokens like name, literal string, integer, real number, and special character.

\item{2.} An arrow ``\code{\^\/}'' in the textual parameter list refers to the current text selection for continuation. In the special case of the arrow following the command name immediately, the entire parameter list is represented by the text selection.

\item{3.} An asterisk ``\code{*}'' in the textual parameter list refers to the currently marked viewer. Typically, the asterisk replaces the name of a file. In such a case the contents of the viewer marked by the system pointer (star) is processed by the command interpreter instead of the contents of a file.

\item{4.} An at-character ``\code{@}' in the textual parameter list indicates that the selection marks the (beginning of the) text which is taken as operand.

\item{5.} A terminator-character ``\code{\~{}}'' terminates the textual parameter list in case of a variable number of parameters.

\noindent Because command tools are ordinary, editable texts (in contrast to
menus in conventional systems) they can be customized ``on the fly'',
which makes the system highly flexible. We refer again to Figure 3.1
that shows a typical Oberon screen layout consisting of two vertical
tracks, a wider user track on the left and a narrow system track on
the right. Three documents are displayed in the user track: A text, a
graphic, and a picture. In the system track we find one log-viewer
displaying the system log, two tool-viewers making available the
standard system tool and a customized private tool respectively.

In concluding this Chapter, let us exemplify the concepts of command
and tool by the system control section of the \code{System\/}
toolbox. Consisting of the commands \code{SetUser\/}, \code{Date\/},
\code{SetFont\/}, \code{SetColor\/}, and \code{Collect\/} it is used to control
system-wide facilities. In detail, their function is installing the
user's identification, displaying or setting the system date and time,
presetting the system type-font for typed text, setting the system
color, and activating the garbage collector.

In summary, a toolbox is a special form of an \code{Oberon\/} module. It is
defined as a collection of commands. Appearing at the top of the
modular hierarchy the toolboxes in their entirety fix the system’s
user interface. Command tools are sequences of textually represented
command calls. They are editable and customizable. In a typical Oberon
screen layout the tools are displayed in viewers within the system
track.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 4: THE DISPLAY SYSTEM.

The display screen is the most important part of the interface
presented by a personal workstation to its users. At first sight, it
simply represents a rectangular output area. However, in combination
with the mouse, it quickly develops into a sophisticated interactive
input/output platform of almost unlimited flexibility. It is mainly
its Janus-faced characteristic that makes the display screen stand out
from ordinary external devices to be managed by the operating
system. In the current chapter we shall give more detailed insight
into the reasons for the central position the display system takes
within the operating system, and for its determining influence on the
entire system architecture. In particular, we shall show that the
display system is a natural basis or anchor for functional
extensibility. % definintion; janus-faced: having two sharply contrasting aspects or characteristics; insincere or deceitful.

\beginsubsection 4.1. THE SCREEN LAYOUT MODEL.

In the early seventies, Xerox \acro{PARC} in California launched the
Smalltalk-project with the goal of conceiving and developing new and
more natural ways to communicate with personal computers
\footnote{{\mc[1]}}{A. Goldberg, Smalltalk-80: The Interactive Programming Environment, Addison-Wesley 1984.}. Perhaps the most conspicuous among several significant
achievements of this endeavor is the idea of applying the desktop
metaphor to the display screen. This metaphor comprises a desktop and
a collection of possibly mutually overlapping pages of paper that are
laid out on the desktop. By projecting such a configuration onto the
surface of a screen we get the familiar picture of Figure 4.1 showing
a collection of partially or totally visible rectangular areas on a
background, so-called \emph{windows} or \emph{viewers}.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.1.png}{2.7in}{4.1}{Desktop showing partially overlapping viewers}

The desktop metaphor is used by many modern operating systems and user
interface shells both as a natural model for the system to separate
displayed data belonging to different tasks, and as a powerful tool
for users to organize the display screen interactively, according to
individual taste and preference. However, there are inherent drawbacks
in the metaphor. They are primarily connected with
overlapping. Firstly, any efficient management of overlapping viewers
must rely on a subordinate management of (arbitrary) sub-rectangles
and on sophisticated clipping operations. This is so because partially
overlapped viewers must be partially restored under control of the
viewer manager. For example, in Figure 4.1, rectangles a, b, and c in
viewer B ought to be restored individually after closing of viewer
A. Secondly, there is a significant danger of covering viewers
completely and losing them forever. And thirdly, no canonical
heuristic algorithms exist for automatic allocation of screen space to
newly opened viewers.

Experience has shown that partial overlapping is desirable and
beneficial in rare cases only, and so the additional complexity of its
management \footnote{{\mc[1]}}{C. Binding, User Interface Components based on a Multiple Window Package, University of Washington, Seattle, Technical Report 85-08-07.}
\footnote{{\mc[2]}}{M. Wille, Overview: Entwurf und Realisierung eines Fenstersystems für Arbeitsplatzrechner, Diss. ETH Nr. 8771, 1988.}
is hard to justify. Therefore, alternate
strategies to structure a display screen have been looked for. An
interesting class of established solutions can be titled as \emph{tiling}.
There are several variants of tiling \footnote{{\mc[3]}}{E.S. Cohen, E.T. Smith, L.A. Iverson, Constraint-Based Tiled Windows, IEEE, 1985}. Perhaps the
most obvious one (because the most unconstrained one) is based on
iterated horizontal or vertical splitting of existing
viewers. Starting with the full screen and successively opening
viewers A, B, C, D, E, and F we get to a configuration as in Figure
4.2.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.2.png}{2.7in}{4.2}{Viewer configuration resulting from unconstrained tiling}

A second variant is hierarchic tiling. Again, the hierarchy starts
with a full screen that is now decomposed into a number of vertical
tracks, each of which is further decomposed into a number of
horizontal viewers. We decided in favor of this kind of tiling in
Oberon, mainly because the algorithm of reusing the area of a closed
viewer is simpler and more uniform. For example, assume that in Figure
4.2 viewer F has been closed. Then, it is straightforward to reverse
the previous opening operation by extending viewer E at its bottom
end. However, if the closed viewer is B, no such simple procedure
exists. For example, the freed area can be shared between viewers C
and D by making them extend to their left. Clearly, no such
complicated situations can occur in the case of hierarchic tiling.

Hierarchic tiling is also used in Xerox \acro{PARC}'s Cedar system
\footnote{{\mc [4]}}{W. Teitelman, ``A tour through Cedar'', IEEE Software, 1, (2), 44-73 (1984).
}. However, the Oberon variant differs from the Cedar
variant in some respects. Firstly, Oberon supports quick temporary
context switching by overlaying one track or any contiguous sequence
of tracks with new layers. In Figure 4.3 a snapshot of a standard
Oberon display screen is graphically represented. It suggests two
original tracks and two levels of overlay, where the top layer is
screen-filling. Secondly, unlike Cedar display screens, Oberon
displays do not provide reserved areas for system-wide facilities,
Standard Cedar screens feature a command row at the top and an icon
row at the bottom. And thirdly, Oberon is based on a different
heuristic strategy for the automatic placement of new viewers. As a
Cedar default invariant, the area of every track is divided up evenly
among the viewers in this track. When a new viewer is to be placed,
the existing viewers in the track are requested to reduce their size
and move up appropriately. The newly opened viewer is then allocated
in the freed spot at the bottom. In contrast, Oberon normally splits
the largest existing viewer in a given track into two halves of equal
size. As an advantage of this latter allocation strategy we note that
existing contents are kept stable.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.3.png}{4.7in}{4.3}{Overlay of tracks and sequences of tracks}

\beginsubsection 4.2. VIEWERS AS OBJECTS.

Although everybody seems to agree on the meaning of the term viewer,
no two different system designers actually do. The original role of a
viewer as merely a separate display area has meanwhile become heavily
overloaded with additional functionality. Depending on the underlying
system are viewers' individual views on a certain configuration of
objects, carriers of tasks, processes, applications, etc. Therefore,
we first need to define our own precise understanding of the concept
of viewer.

The best guide to this aim is the abstract data type \code{Viewer\/} that we
introduced in Chapter 3. We recapitulate: Type \code{Viewer\/} serves as a
template describing viewers abstractly as ``black boxes'' in terms of a
state of visibility, a rectangle on the display screen, and a message
handler. The exact functional interface provided by a given variant of
viewer is determined by the set of messages accepted. This set is
structured as a customized hierarchy of type extensions.

We can now obtain a more concrete specification of the role of viewer
by identifying some basic categories of universal messages that are
expected to be accepted by all variants of viewer. For example, we
know that messages reporting about user interactions as well as
messages defining a generic operation are universal. These two
categories of universal messages document the roles of viewers as
interactive tasks and as parts of an integrated system respectively.

In total, there are four such categories. They are here listed
together with the corresponding topics and message dispatchers:
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
Dispatcher&Topic&Message\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
Task scheduler      & dispatching of task     & reports user interaction \cr
Command interpreter & processing of command   & defines generic operation \cr
Viewer manager      & organizing display area & change of location or size \cr
Document manager    & operating on document   & change of contents or format \cr
}
\medskip
These topics essentially define the role of Oberon viewers. In short,
we may look at an Oberon viewer as a non-overlapped rectangular box on
the screen both acting as an integrated display area for some objects
of a document and representing an interactive task in the form of a
sensitive editing area.

Shifting emphasis a little and regarding the various message
dispatchers as subsystems, we recognize immediately the role of
viewers as integrators of the different subsystems via message-based
interfaces. In this light type \code{Viewer} appears as a common
object-oriented basis of Oberon's subsystems.

The topics listed above constitute some kind of backbone of the
contents of the Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Task scheduling and command
interpreting are already familiar to us from Sections 3.2 and
3.3. Viewer management and text management will be the topics of
Sections 4.4 and 5.2 respectively. Thereby, the built-in type \code{Text}
will serve as a prime example of a document type.

The activities that a viewer performs are basically controlled by
\emph{events} or, more precisely, by messages representing \emph{event notices}. We
shall explain this in detail in Sections 4.4 and 5.3 in the cases of
an abstract class of standard viewers and a class of viewers
displaying standard text respectively.

Here is a preliminary overview of some archetypal kinds of message:

\item\bullet After each key stroke a \emph{keyboard message} containing the typed character is sent to the current \emph{focus viewer} and after each mouse click a \emph{mouse message} reporting the new state of the mouse is sent to the viewer containing the current mouse position.

\item\bullet A message often represents some \emph{generic operation} that is expected to be interpreted individually by its recipients. Obvious examples in our context are ``return current textual selection'', ``copy-over stretch of text'', and ``produce a copy (clone)''. Notice that generic operations are the key to extensibility.

\item\bullet In a tiling viewer environment, every opening of a new viewer and every change of size or location of an existing viewer has an obvious effect on adjacent viewers. The viewer manager therefore issues a message for every affected viewer requesting it to adjust its size appropriately.

\item\bullet Whenever the contents or the format of a document has changed, a message notifying all visible viewers of the change is broadcast. Notice that broadcasting messages by a \emph{model} (document) to the entirety of its potential views (viewers) is an interesting implementation of the famous \acro{MVC} (\emph{model-view-controller}) pattern that dispenses models from ``knowing'' (registering) their views.

\beginsubsection 4.3. FRAMES AS BASIC DISPLAY ENTITIES.

When we introduced viewers in Chapter 3 and in the previous section, we simplified with the aim of abstraction. We know already that viewers appear as elements of second order in the tiling hierarchy. Having treated them as black boxes so far we have not revealed anything about the continuation of the hierarchy. As a matter of fact, viewers are neither elementary display entities nor atoms. They are just a special case of so-called \emph{display frames}. Display frames or frames in short are arbitrary rectangles displaying a collection of objects or an excerpt of a document. In particular, frames may recursively contain other frames, a capability that makes them an extremely powerful tool for any display organizer.

The type \code{Frame\/} is declared as
\begintt
Frame = POINTER TO FrameDesc;
FrameDesc = RECORD
  next, dsc: Frame;
  X, Y, W, H: INTEGER;
  handle: Handler
END;
\endtt

\noindent The components \code{next\/} and \code{dsc\/} are connections to further frames. Their names suggest a multi-level recursive hierarchical structure: \code{next\/} points to the next frame on the same level, while \code{dsc\/} points to the (first) descendant, i.e. to the next lower level of the hierarchy of nested frames. \code{X\/}, \code{Y\/}, \code{W\/}, \code{H\/}, and the handler handle serve the original purpose to that we introduced them. In particular, the handler allows frames to react individually on the receipt of messages. Its type is
\begintt
Handler = PROCEDURE (F: Frame; VAR M: FrameMsg);
\endtt

\noindent where \code{FrameMsg} represents the root of a potentially unlimited tree hierarchy of possible messages to frames:
\begintt
FrameMsg = RECORD END;
\endtt

\noindent Having now introduced the concept of frames, we can reveal the whole truth about viewers. As a matter of fact, type \code{Viewer\/} is a derived type, it is a type extension of \code{Frame\/}:
\begintt
Viewer = POINTER TO ViewerDesc;
ViewerDesc = RECORD (FrameDesc)
  state: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent These declarations formally express the fact that viewers
are nothing but a special case (or variant or subclass) of general
frames, additionally featuring a state of visibility. In particular,
viewers inherit the hierarchical structure of frames. This is an
extremely useful property immediately opening an unlimited spectrum of
possibilities for designers of a specific subclass of viewers to
organize the representing rectangular area. For example, the area of
viewers of, say, class \code{Desktop\/} may take the role of a background being
covered by an arbitrary collection of possibly mutually overlapping
frames. In other words, our decision of using a tiling viewer scheme
\emph{globally} can easily be overwritten \emph{locally}.

An even more important example of a predefined structure is provided
by the abstract class of so-called \emph{menu viewers} whose shape is
familiar from most snapshots taken of the standard Oberon display
screen. A menu viewer consists of a thin rectangular boundary line and
an interior area being vertically decomposed into a menu region at the
top and a contents region at the bottom (see Figure 4.4).

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.4.png}{4.7in}{4.4}{The compositional structure of a menu viewer}

In terms of data structures, the class of menu viewers is defined as a
type extension of \code{Viewer\/} with an additional component \code{menuH\/}
specifying the height of the menu frame:
\begintt
MenuViewer = POINTER TO MenuViewerDesc;
MenuViewerDesc = RECORD (ViewerDesc)
  menuH: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent Each menu viewer \code{V\/} specifies exactly two
descendants: The menu frame \code{V.dsc\/} and the frame of main
contents or main frame \code{V.dsc.next\/}. Absolutely nothing is fixed
about the contents of the two descendant frames. In the standard case,
however, the menu frame is a text frame, displaying a line of commands
in inverse video mode. By definition, the nature of the main frame
specifies the type of the viewer. If it is a text frame as well, then
we call the viewer a \emph{text viewer}, if it a graphics frame, we call it a
\emph{graphics viewer} etc.

\beginsubsection 4.4. DISPLAY MANAGEMENT.

Oberon's display system comprises two main topics: Viewer management
and cursor handling. Let us first turn to the much more involved topic
of viewer management and postpone cursor handling to the end of this
Section. Before we can actually begin our explanations we need to
introduce the concept of the \emph{logical display area}. It is modeled as a
two-dimensional Cartesian plane housing the totality of objects to be
displayed. The essential point of this abstraction is a rigorous
decoupling of any aspects of physical display devices. As a matter of
fact, any concrete assignment of display monitors to certain finite
regions of the display area is a pure matter of configuring the
system.

Being a subsystem of a system with a well-defined modular structure
the display system appears in the form of a small hierarchy of
modules. Its core is a linearly ordered set consisting of three
modules: \code{Display\/}, \code{Viewers\/}, and \code{MenuViewers\/}, the latter building upon
the formers. Conceptually, each module contributes an associated class
of display-oriented objects and a collection of related service
routines.

The following is an overview of the subsystem viewer
management. Modules on upper lines import modules on lower lines and
types on upper lines extend types on lower lines.
\medskip

Viewers    & Viewer & Tiling viewer management          \cr

}
\medskip
Inspecting the column titled \emph{Type} we recognize precisely our familiar types \code{Frame\/}, \code{Viewer\/}, and \code{MenuViewer\/} respectively, where the latter is an abbreviation of \code{MenuViewers.Viewer\/}.

In addition to the core modules of the display system a section in module \code{Oberon\/} provides a specialized application programming interface (\acro{API}) that simplifies the use of the viewer management package by applications in the case of standard Oberon display configurations. We shall come back to this topic in Section 4.6.

For the moment let us concentrate on the core of the viewer management and in particular on the modules \code{Viewers\/} and \code{MenuViewers\/}, saving the discussion of the module \code{Display\/} for the next section. Typically, we start the presentation of a module by listing and commenting its definition, and we refer to subsequent listings for its implementation.

\beginsubsubsection 4.4.1. Viewers.


Focusing first on module \code{Viewers\/} we can roughly define the domain of
its responsibility as ``initializing and maintaining the global layout
of the display area''. From the previous discussion we are well
acquainted already with the structure of the global display space as
well as with its building blocks: The display area is hierarchically
tiled with display frames, where the first two levels in the frame
hierarchy correspond to \emph{tracks} and \emph{viewers} respectively.

This is the formal definition:
\begintt
DEFINITION Viewers;
  IMPORT Display;
  CONST restore = 0; modify = 1; suspend = 2; (*message ids*)
  TYPE Viewer = POINTER TO ViewerDesc;
       ViewerDesc = RECORD (Display.FrameDesc)
         state: INTEGER
       END;
       ViewerMsg = RECORD (Display.FrameMsg)
         id: INTEGER;
         X, Y, W, H: INTEGER;
         state: INTEGER
       END;

  VAR curW: INTEGER;
       
  (*track handling*)
  PROCEDURE InitTrack (W, H: INTEGER; Filler: Viewer);
  PROCEDURE OpenTrack (X, W: INTEGER; Filler: Viewer);
  PROCEDURE CloseTrack (X: INTEGER);

  (*viewer handling*)
  PROCEDURE Open (V: Viewer; X, Y: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Change (V: Viewer; Y: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Close (V: Viewer);

  (*miscellaneous*)
  PROCEDURE This (X, Y: INTEGER): Viewer;
  PROCEDURE Next (V: Viewer): Viewer;
  PROCEDURE Recall (VAR V: Viewer);
  PROCEDURE Locate (X, H: INTEGER; VAR fil, bot, alt, max: Viewer);
  PROCEDURE Broadcast (VAR M: Display.FrameMsg);
END Viewers.
\endtt

\noindent Some comments: A first group of procedures consisting of \code{InitTrack}, \code{OpenTrack}, and \code{CloseTrack} supports the track structure of the display area. \code{InitTrack} creates a new track of width \code{W} and height \code{H} by partitioning off a vertical strip of width \code{W} from the display area. In addition, \code{InitTrack} initializes the newly created track with a \emph{filler viewer} that is supplied as a parameter. The filler viewer essentially serves as background filling up the track at its top end. It reduces to height 0 if the track is covered completely by productive viewers.

Configuring the display area is part of system initialization after
startup. It amounts to executing a sequence of steps of the form
\begintt
NEW(Filler); Filler.handle := HandleFiller; InitTrack(W, H, Filler)
\endtt

\noindent where \code{HandleFiller\/} is supposed to handle messages
that require modifications of size and cursor drawing.

The global variable \code{curW\/} indicates the width of the already configured
part of the display area. Note that configuring starts with \code{x = 0\/} and
is non-reversible in the sense that the grid defined by the
initialized tracks cannot be refined later. However, remember that it
can be coarsened at any time by overlaying a contiguous sequence of
existing tracks by a single new track.

Procedure \code{OpenTrack\/} serves exactly this purpose. The track (or
sequence of tracks) to be overlaid in the display-area must be spanned
by the segment \code{[X, X + W)\/}. Procedure \code{CloseTrack\/} is inverse to
\code{OpenTrack\/}. It is called to close the (topmost) track located at \code{X\/} in
the display area, and to restore the previously covered track (or
sequence of tracks).

The next three procedures are used to organize viewers within
individual tracks. Procedure \code{Open\/} allocates a given viewer at a given
position. More precisely, \code{Open} locates the viewer containing the point
\code{(X, Y)}, splits it horizontally at height \code{Y}, and opens the viewer \code{V} in
the lower part of the area. In the special case of \code{Y} coinciding with
the upper boundary line of the located viewer this is closed
automatically. Procedure \code{Change} allows to change the height of a given
viewer \code{V} by moving its upper boundary line to a new location \code{Y\/} (within
the limits of its neighbors). Procedure \code{Close} removes the given viewer
\code{V} from the display area. Figure 4.5 makes these operations clear.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.5.png}{4.7in}{4.5}{Basic operations on viewers}

The last group of procedures provides miscellaneous
services. Procedure \code{This} identifies the viewer displayed at \code{(X, Y)}.
Procedure \code{Next} returns the next upper neighbor of a given
displayed viewer \code{V\/}. Procedure \code{Recall} allows recalling and restoring
the most recently closed viewer. \code{Locate} is a procedure that assists
heuristic allocation of new viewers. For any given track and desired
minimum height, procedure \code{Locate} offers a choice of some distinguished
viewers in the track: the filler viewer, the viewer at the bottom, an
alternative choice, and the viewer of maximum height. Finally,
procedure \code{Broadcast} broadcasts a message to the display area, that is,
sends the given message to all viewers that are currently displayed.

It is now a good time to throw a glance behind the scenes. Let us
start with revealing module \code{Viewer}'s internal data structure. Remember
that according to the principle of information hiding an internal data
structure is fully private to the containing module and accessible
through the module’s procedural interface only. Figure 4.6 shows a
data structure view of the display snapshot taken in Figure 4.4. Note
that the overlaid tracks and viewers are still part of the internal
data structure.

In the data structure we recognize an anchor that represents the
display area and points to a list of tracks, each of them in turn
pointing to a list of viewers, each of them in turn pointing to a list
of arbitrary sub-frames. Both the list of tracks and the list of
viewers are closed to a ring, where the filler track (filling up the
display area) and the filler viewers (filling up the tracks) act as
anchors. Additionally, each track points to a (possibly empty) list of
tracks lying underneath. These frames are invisible on the display,
and shaded in Figure 4.6.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.6.png}{4in}{4.6}{A snapshot of the internal data structure corresponding to Figure 4.3}

Technically, the track descriptor type \code{TrackDesc} is a private
extension of the viewer descriptor type \code{ViewerDesc}. Repeating the
declarations of viewer descriptors and frame descriptors, we get to
this hierarchy of types:
\begintt
TrackDesc = RECORD (ViewerDesc)
  under: Display.Frame
END;

ViewerDesc = RECORD (FrameDesc)
  state: INTEGER
END;

FrameDesc = RECORD
  next, dsc: Frame;
  X, Y, W, H: INTEGER;
  handle: Handler
END;
\endtt

\noindent It is noteworthy that the data structure of the viewer manager is \emph{heterogeneous} with \code{Frame} as base type. It provides a nice example of a nested hierarchy of frames with the additional property that the first two levels correspond to the first two levels in the type hierarchy defined by \code{Track}, \code{Viewer}, and \code{Frame}.

In an object-oriented environment objects are autonomous entities in
principle. However, they may be bound to some higher instance (other
than the system) temporarily. For example, we can look at the objects
belonging to a module's private data structure as bound to this
module. Deciding if an object is currently bound is then a fundamental
problem. In the case of viewers, this information is contained in an
extra instance variable called \code{state}.

As a system invariant, we have for every viewer \code{V}
$$\code{V}\ is\ bound\ to\ module\ \code{Viewers} \Longleftrightarrow\ \code{V.state} \neq\ 0$$
If we call visible any displayed viewer and suspended any viewer that
is covered by an overlaying track we can refine this invariant to
$$(\code{V}\ is\ visible\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \code{v.state} > 0) \land (\code{V}\ is\ suspended\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \code{v.state} < 0)$$
In addition, more detailed information about the kind of viewer \code{V} is given by the magnitude
$\mid\code{V.state}\mid$:
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
\code{V.state}&Kind of viewer\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
0  & closed \cr
1  & filler \cr
-1 & productive \cr
}
\medskip
The magnitude $\mid\code{V.state}\mid$ is kept invariant by module \code{Viewers}. It could
be used, for example, to distinguish different levels of importance or
preference with the aim of supporting a smarter algorithm for
heuristic allocation of new viewers. The variable state is treated as
read-only by every module other than \code{Viewers}.

We are now sufficiently prepared to understand how the exported
procedures of module \code{Viewers} work behind the scenes. All of them
operate on the internal dynamic data structure just explained. Some
use the structure as a reference only or operate on individual
elements (procedures \code{This}, \code{Next}, \code{Locate}, \code{Change}), others add new
elements to the structure (procedures \code{InitTrack}, \code{OpenTrack}, \code{Open}), and
even others remove elements (procedures \code{CloseTrack}, \code{Close}). Most
procedures have side-effects on the size or state of existing
elements.

Let us now change perspective and look at module \code{Viewers} as a general low-level manager of viewers whose exact contents are unknown to it (and whose controlling software might have been developed years later). In short, let us look at module \code{Viewers} as a manager of \emph{black boxes}. Such an abstraction immediately makes it impossible for the implementation to call fixed procedures for, say, changing a viewer's size or state. The facility needed is a message-oriented interface.
\begintt
TYPE ViewerMsg = RECORD (Display.FrameMsg)
  id: INTEGER;
  X, Y, W, H: INTEGER;
  state: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent There exist three variants of \code{Viewer} messages, discriminated by the
field \code{id}: Restore contents, modify height (extend or reduce at
bottom), and suspend (close temporarily or permanently). The
additional components of the message inform about the desired new
location, size, and state.

The following table lists senders, messages, and recipients of viewer messages.
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
Originator & Message & Recipients \cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
\code{OpenTrack}  & Suspend temporarily & Viewers covered by opening track \cr
\code{CloseTrack} & Suspend permanently & Viewers in closing track         \cr
\code{Open}       & Modify or suspend   & Upper neighbor of opening viewer \cr
\code{Change}     & Modify              & Upper neighbor of changing viewer\cr
\code{Close}      & Suspend permanently & Closing viewer                   \cr
}
\medskip
\beginsubsubsection 4.4.2. Menu Viewers.

So far, we have treated viewers abstractly as black boxes. Our next
step is now to focus on a special class of viewers called \emph{menu viewers}. Remembering the definition given earlier we know that a menu
viewer is characterized by a structure consisting of two vertically
tiled ``descendant'' frames, a \emph{menu frame} at the top and a \emph{frame of contents} at the bottom. Because the nature and contents of these
frames are typically unknown by their ``ancestor'' (or ``parent'') viewer,
a collection of abstract messages is again a postulating form of
interface. As net effect, the handling of menu viewers boils down to a
combination of preprocessing, transforming and forwarding messages to
the descendant frames. In short, the display space in Oberon is
hierarchically organized and message passing within the display space
obeys the pattern of strict \emph{parental control}.

Again, we start our more detailed discussion with a module interface definition:
\begintt
DEFINITION MenuViewers;
  IMPORT Viewers, Display;
  CONST extend = 0; reduce = 1; move = 2; (*message ids*)

  TYPE
    Viewer = POINTER TO ViewerDesc;
    ViewerDesc = RECORD (Viewers.ViewerDesc)
      menuH: INTEGER
    END;
    ModifyMsg = RECORD (Display.FrameMsg)
      id: INTEGER;
      dY, Y, H: INTEGER
    END;
  PROCEDURE Handle (V: Display.Frame; VAR M: Display.FrameMsg);
  PROCEDURE New (Menu, Main: Display.Frame;
                 menuH, X, Y: INTEGER): Viewer;
END MenuViewers.
\endtt

\noindent The interface represented by this definition is conspicuously
narrow. There are just two procedures: A generator procedure \code{New} and a
standard message handler \code{Handle}. The generator returns a newly created
menu viewer displaying the two (arbitrary) frames passed as
parameters. The message handler implements the entire ``\emph{behavior}'' of an
object and in particular the above mentioned message dispatching
functionality.

Message handlers in Oberon are implemented in the form of procedure
variables that obviously must be initialized properly at object
creation time. In other words, some concrete behavior must explicitly
be bound to each object, where different instances of the same object
type could potentially have a different behavior and/or the same
instance could change its behavior during its lifetime. Our object
model is therefore instance-centered.

Conceptually, the creation of an object is an atomic action consisting
of three basic steps: 1. Allocate memory block; 2. Install message handler; 3. Initialize state variables.

In the case of a standard menu viewer \code{V} this can be expressed as
\begintt
NEW(V);
V.handle := Handle;
V.dsc := Menu;
V.dsc.next := Main;
V.menuH := menuH
\endtt

\noindent With that, calling \code{New} is equivalent with
\begintt
create V; open V at X, Y
\endtt

\noindent where opening \code{V} needs assistance by module \code{Viewers}.

The implementation of procedure \code{Handle} embodies the standard strategy of message handling by
menu viewers. The following code is a coarse-grained view of it.
\begintt
Message handler for menu viewers

IF message reports about user interaction THEN
  IF variant is mouse tracking THEN
    IF mouse is in menu region THEN
      IF mouse is in upper menu region and left key is pressed THEN
        handle changing of viewer
      ELSE delegate handling to menu-frame
      END
    ELSE
      IF mouse is in main-frame THEN delegate handling to main-frame END
    END
  ELSIF variant is keyboard input THEN
    delegate handling to menu frame;
    delegate handling to main frame
  END
ELSIF message defines generic operation THEN
  IF message requests copy (clone) THEN
    send copy message to menu frame to get a copy (clone);
    send copy message to main frame to get a copy (clone);
    create menu viewer clone from copies
  ELSE
    delegate handling to menu frame; delegate handling to main frame
  END
ELSIF message reports about change of contents THEN
  delegate handling to menu frame;
  delegate handling to main frame
ELSIF message requests change of location or size THEN
  IF operation is restore THEN
    draw viewer area and border;
    send modify message to menu frame to make it extend from height 0;
    send modify message to main frame to make it extend from height 0
  ELSIF operation is modify THEN
    IF operation is extend THEN
      extend viewer area and border;
      send modify message to menu frame to make it extend;
      send modify message to main frame to make it extend
    ELSE (*reduce*)
      send modify message to main frame to make it reduce;
      send modify message to menu frame to make it reduce;
      reduce viewer area and border
    END
  ELSIF operation is suspend THEN
    send modify message to main frame to make it reduce to height 0;
    send modify message to menu frame to make it reduce to height 0
  END
END
\endtt

\noindent In principle, the handler acts as a \emph{message dispatcher} that
either processes a message directly and/or delegates its processing to
the descendant frames. Note that the handler's main alternative
statement discriminates precisely among the four basic categories of
messages.

From the above outlined algorithm handling \emph{copy messages}, that
is, requests for generating a \emph{copy} or \emph{clone} of a menu
viewer, we can derive a general recursive scheme for the creation of a
clone of an arbitrary frame:

send \emph{copy} message to each element in the list of descendants;

generate copy of the original frame descriptor;

attach copies of descendants to the copy of descriptor

\noindent The essential point here is the use of new \emph{outgoing} messages in order
to process a given \emph{incoming} message. We can regard message processing
as a transformation that maps incoming messages into a set of outgoing
messages, with possible side-effects. The simplest case of such a
transformation is known as \emph{delegation}. In this case, the input message
is simply passed on to the descendant(s).

As a fine point we clarify that the above algorithm is designed to
create a \emph{deep} copy of a composite object (a menu viewer in our
case). If a \emph{shallow} copy would be desired, the descendants would not
have to be copied, and the original descendants instead of their
copies would be attached to the copy of the composite object.

Another example of message handling is provided by mouse
tracking. Assume that a \emph{mouse message} is received by a menu viewer
while the mouse is located in the upper part of its menu frame and the
left mouse key is kept down. This means ``change viewer's height by
moving its top line vertically''. No message to express the required
transformation of the sub-frames yet exists. Consequently, module
\code{MenuViewers\/} takes advantage of our open (extensible) message model and
simply introduces an appropriate message type called \code{ModifyMsg\/}:
\begintt
ModifyMsg = RECORD (Display.FrameMsg)
  id: INTEGER;
  dY, Y, H: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent The field \code{id} specifies one of two variants: \code{extend} or \code{reduce}. The first variant of the message requests the receiving frame to move by the vertical translation vector \code{dY\/} and then to extend to height \code{H} at bottom. The second variant requests the frame to reduce to height \code{H} at bottom and then to move by \code{dY}. In both cases \code{Y} indicates the Y-coordinate of the new lower-left corner. Figure 4.7 summarizes this graphically.

Messages arriving from the viewer manager and requesting the receiving viewer to extend or reduce at its bottom are also mapped into messages of type \code{ModifyMsg}. Of course, no translation is needed in these cases, and \code{dY} is 0.

The attentive reader might perhaps have asked why the standard handler
is exported by module \code{MenuViewers} at all. The thought behind is
reusability of code. For example, a message handler for a subclass of
menu viewers could be implemented effectively by reusing menu viewer's
standard handler. After having handled all new or differing cases
first it would simply (super-)call the standard handler subsequently.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.7.png}{4.7in}{4.7}{The modify frame operation}

\beginsubsubsection 4.4.3. Cursor Management.

Traditionally, a cursor indicates and visualizes on the screen the
current location of the \emph{caret} in a text or, more generally, the
current \emph{focus} of attention. A small arrow or similar graphic symbol is
typically used for this purpose. In Oberon, we have slightly
generalized and abstracted this concept. A cursor is a path in the
logical display area whose current position can be made visible by a
\emph{marker}.

The viewer manager and the cursor handler are two concurrent users of
the same display area. Actually, we should imagine two parallel
planes, one displaying viewers and the other displaying cursors. If
there is just one physical plane we take care of painting markers
non-destructively, for example in inverse-video mode. Then, no
precondition must be established before drawing a marker. However, in
the case of a viewer task painting destructively in its viewer's area,
the area must be locked first after turning invisible all markers in
the area.

The technical support of cursor management is again contained in
module \code{Oberon\/}. The corresponding application programming interface is
\begintt
DEFINITION Oberon;
  TYPE Marker = RECORD
      Fade, Draw: PROCEDURE (x, y: INTEGER)
    END;
    Cursor = RECORD
      marker: Marker;
      on: BOOLEAN;
      X, Y: INTEGER
    END;
  VAR Arrow, Star: Marker;
      Mouse, Pointer: Cursor;
  PROCEDURE OpenCursor (VAR c: Cursor);
  PROCEDURE FadeCursor (VAR c: Cursor);
  PROCEDURE DrawCursor (VAR c: Cursor; VAR m: Marker;
                        X, Y: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE MarkedViewer (): Viewers.Viewer;
  PROCEDURE RemoveMarks (X, Y, W, H: INTEGER);
  ...
END Oberon.
\endtt

\noindent The state of a cursor is given by its mode of visibility (on), its
position (\code{X}, \code{Y}) in the display area, and the current marker. \code{Marker} is
an abstract data type with an interface consisting of two operations
\code{Fade} and \code{Draw}. The main benefit we can draw from this abstraction is
once more conceptual independence of the underlying hardware. For
example, \code{Fade} and \code{Draw} can adapt to a given monitor hardware with
built-in cursor support or, in case of absence of such support, can
simply be implemented as identical procedures (an involution) drawing
the marker pattern in inverse video mode.

The functional interface to cursors consists of three operations:
\code{OpenCursor} to open a new cursor, \code{FadeCursor} to switch off the marker
of an open cursor, and \code{DrawCursor} to extend the path of a cursor to a
new position and mark it with the given marker. We emphasize that the
marker representing a given cursor can change its shape dynamically on
the fly.

Two cursors, \code{Mouse\/} and \code{Pointer\/} are predefined. They represent the
mouse and an interactively controlled global system pointer
respectively. Typically (but not necessarily) these cursors are
visualized by the built-in markers \code{Arrow\/} (a small arrow pointing to
north-west) and \code{Star\/} (a star symbol) respectively. The pointer can be
used to mark any displayed object. It serves primarily as an implicit
parameter of commands.

Two assisting service procedures \code{MarkedViewer\/} and \code{RemoveMarks\/} are
added in connection with the predefined cursors. \code{MarkedViewer\/} returns
the viewer that is currently marked by the pointer. Its resulting
value is equivalent to \code{Viewers.This(Pointer.X, Pointer.Y)\/}. \code{RemoveMarks\/}
turns invisible the predefined cursors within a given rectangle in the
display area. This procedure is used to lock the rectangle for its
caller.

Summary of the essential points and characteristics of Oberon's concept of cursor handling:

\item{1.} By virtue of the use of abstract markers and of the logical display area, any potential hardware dependence is encapsulated in system modules and is therefore hidden from the application programmer. Cursors are moving uniformly within the whole display area, even across screen boundaries.

\item{2.} Cursor handling is decentralized by delegating it to the individual handlers that are installed in viewers. Typically, a handler reacts on the receipt of a mouse tracking message by drawing the mouse cursor at the indicated new position. The benefit of such individualized handling is flexibility. For example, a smart local handler might choose the shape of the visualizing marker depending on the exact location, or it might force the cursor onto a grid point.

\item{3.} Even though cursor handling is decentralized, there is some intrinsic support for cursor drawing built into the declaration of type \code{Cursor\/}. Cursors are objects of full value and, as such, can ``memorize'' their current state. Consequently, the interface operations \code{FadeCursor\/} and \code{DrawCursor\/} need to refer to the desired future state only.

\item{4.} Looking at the viewer manager as one user of the display area, the cursor handler is a second (and logically concurrent) user of the same resource. If there is just one physical plane implementing the display area, any region must be locked by a current user before destructive painting. Therefore, markers are usually painted non-destructively in inverse-video mode.

\noindent Let us now recapitulate the entire Section. The central resource
managed by the display subsystem is the logical display area whose
purpose is abstraction from the underlying display monitor
hardware. The display area is primarily used by the viewer manager for
the accommodation of tracks and viewers, which are merely the first
two levels of a potentially unlimited nested hierarchy of display
frames. For example, standard menu viewers contain two subordinate
frames: A menu frame and a main frame of contents. Viewers are treated
as black boxes by the viewer manager and are addressed via
messages. Viewers and, more generally frames, are used as elements of
message-based interfaces connecting the display subsystem with other
subsystems like the task scheduler and the various document
managers. Finally, the display area is also the living room of
cursors. In Oberon, a cursor is a marked path. Two standard cursors
\code{Mouse} and \code{Pointer} are predefined.

\beginsubsection 4.5. RASTER OPERATIONS.

In Section 4.4 we introduced the display area as an abstract concept,
modeled as a two-dimensional Cartesian plane. So far, this view of
the display space was sufficient because we were interested in its
global structure only and ignored contents completely. However, if we
are interested in the displayed contents, we need to reveal more
details about the model.

The Cartesian plane representing the display area is \emph{discrete}. We
consider points in the display area as grid points or \emph{picture elements}
(\emph{pixels}), and we assume contents to be generated by assigning colors
to the pixels. For the moment, the number of possible colors a pixel
can attain is irrelevant. In the binary case of two colors we think of
one color representing \emph{background} and the other color representing
\emph{foreground}.

The most elementary operation generating contents in a discrete plane
is ``set color of pixel'' or ``set pixel'' for short. While a few drawing
algorithms directly build on this atomic operation, block-oriented
functionality (traditionally called raster operations) plays a much
more important role in practice. By a \emph{block} we mean a rectangular area
of pixels whose bounding lines are parallel to the axes of the
coordinate system.

Raster operations are based on a common principle: A block of width \code{SW}
and height \code{SH} of source pixels is placed at a given point of
destination (\code{DX}, \code{DY}) in the display area. In the simplest case, the
destination block (\code{DX}, \code{DY}, \code{SW}, \code{SH}) is plainly overwritten by the
source block. In general, the new value of a pixel in the destination
block is a combination of its old value and the value of the
corresponding source pixel:$$d := F(s, d)$$
\emph{F} is sometimes called the \emph{mode} of combination of the
raster operation. The raster is stored as an array of values of type
\code{SET}, each set representing 32 black/white pixels. The modes of
combining source and destination is implemented by the following set
operations:
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
mode&operation\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
replace & $s$ \cr
paint   & $s + d$ (or) \cr
invert  & $s / d$ (xor) \cr
}\medskip
\noindent Note that invert is equivalent with inverse video mode if \code{s} is \code{TRUE}
for all pixels.

There are many different variants of raster operations. Some refer to
a source block in the display area, others specify a constant pattern
to be taken as source block. Some variants require replication of the
source block within a given destination block (\code{DX}, \code{DY}, \code{DW}, \code{DH}) rather
than simple placement.

The challenge when designing a raster interface is finding a unified,
small and complete set of raster operations that covers all needs, in
particular including the need of placing character glyphs. The
amazingly compact resulting set of Oberon raster operations is
exported by module \code{Display}:
\begintt
DEFINITION Display;
  CONST black = 0; white = 1; (*colors*)
        replace = 0; paint = 1; invert = 2; (*operation modes*)
  PROCEDURE Dot (col, x, y, mode: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE ReplConst (col, x, y, w, h, mode: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE CopyPattern (col, patadr, x, y, mode: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE CopyBlock (sx, sy, w, h, dx, dy, mode: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE ReplPattern (col, patadr, x, y, w, h, mode: INTEGER);
END Display.
\endtt

\noindent In the parameter lists of the above raster operations, \code{mode} is the mode of combination (replace, paint, or invert). \code{CopyBlock} copies the source block (\code{sx}, \code{sy}, \code{w}, \code{h}) to position (\code{dx}, \code{dy}) and uses mode to combine new contents in the destination block (\code{dx}, \code{dy}, \code{w}, \code{h}). It is assumed tacitly that the numbers of colors per pixel in the source block and in the destination area are identical. It is perhaps informative to know that \code{CopyBlock} is essentially equivalent with the famous \code{BitBlt} (bit block transfer) in the SmallTalk project \footnote{{\mc[1]}}{A. Goldberg, Smalltalk-80: The Interactive Programming Environment, Addison-Wesley 1984.}. In Oberon, \code{CopyBlock} is used primarily for scrolling contents within a viewer.

The remaining raster operations use a constant pattern. Patterns are
implemented as arrays of bytes, and the parameter patadr is the
address of the relevant pattern. The first two bytes indicate width \code{w}
and height \code{h} of the pattern. Pattern data are given as a sequence of
bytes to be placed into the destination block from left to right and
from bottom to top. Each line takes an integral number of
bytes. Hence, the number of data bytes is $((w+7) \div 8) \times h$. An
example is shown in Figure 4.8.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.8.png}{2.5in}{4.8}{A pattern and its encoding as an array of bytes (in hex)}

Some standard patterns are included in module \code{Display} and exported as
global variables. Among them are patterns arrow, hook, and star
intended to represent the cursor, the caret, and the marker. A second
group of predefined patterns supports drawing graphics.

The parameter \code{col} in the pattern-oriented raster operations specifies the pattern's foreground color. Colors black (background) and white are predefined. Procedure \code{CopyPattern} copies the pattern to location \code{x}, \code{y} in the display area, using the given combination mode. It is probably the most frequently used operation of all because it is needed to write text. Procedure \code{ReplPattern} replicates the given pattern to the given destination block. It starts at bottom left and proceeds from left to right and from bottom to top. Procedures \code{Dot} and \code{ReplConst} are special cases of \code{CopyPattern} and \code{ReplPattern} respectively, taking a fixed implicit pattern consisting of a single foreground pixel. \code{Dot} is exactly our previously mentioned ``set pixel''. \code{ReplConst} is used to draw horizontal and vertical lines of various widths.

The raster operations are a prominent example of the use of Oberon's data type \code{SET\/}. Formally, variables are sets of integers between 0 and 31. Here, they are taken as sets of bits numbered from 0 to 31. We consider the replication of 1's (mode = replace or paint) in the rectangle with origin \code{x}, \code{y}, width \code{w}, and height \code{h}. Every line consists of 1024 pixels, or 32 words. \code{al}, \code{ar}, \code{a0}, \code{a1} are addresses.
\begintt
VAR al, ar, a0, a1: INTEGER; left, right, pixl, pixr: SET;
al := base + y*128;
ar := ((x+w-1) DIV 32)*4 + al; al := (x DIV 32)*4 + al;
left := {(x MOD 32) .. 31}; right := {0 .. ((x+w-1) MOD 32)};
FOR a0 := al TO al + (h-1)*128 BY 128 DO
  SYSTEM.GET(a0, pixl); SYSTEM.GET(ar, pixr);
  SYSTEM.PUT(a0, pixl + left);
  FOR a1 := a0+4 TO ar-4 BY 4 DO SYSTEM.PUT(a1, {0 .. 31}) END;
  SYSTEM.PUT(ar, pixr + right)
END
\endtt

\noindent The definition (and even more so the implementation) of module \code{Display\/}
provides support for a restricted class of possible hardware
configurations only. Any number of display monitors is theoretically
possible. However, they must be mapped to a regular horizontal array
of predefined cells in the display area. Each cell is vertically split
into two congruent regions, where the corresponding monitor is
supposed to be able to select and display one of the two regions
alternatively. Finally, it is assumed that all cells hosting
black-and-white monitors are allocated to the left of all cells
hosting color monitors. Figure 4.9 gives an impression of such a
configuration.

Under these restrictions any concrete configuration can be parameterized by the variables of the definition above. \code{Unit\/}, \code{Width\/}, and \code{Height\/} specify the extent of a displayed region, where \code{Width\/} and \code{Height\/} are width and height in pixel units, and \code{Unit\/} is the size of a pixel in units of 1/36’000 mm. 1/36’000 mm is a common divisor of all of the standard metric units used by the typesetting community, like mm, inch, Pica point and point size of usual printing devices. \code{Bottom\/} and \code{UBottom\/} specify the bottom y-coordinate of the primary region and the secondary region respectively. Finally, \code{Left\/} and \code{ColLeft\/} give the left x-coordinate of the area of black-and-white monitors and of color monitors respectively.

\figure{pdfs/fig-4.9.png}{3.9in}{4.9}{General, regular cell structure of display area}

\beginsubsection 4.6. STANDARD DISPLAY CONFIGURATIONS AND TOOLBOX.

Let us now take up again our earlier topic of configuring the display
area. We have seen that no specific layout of the display area is
distinguished by the general viewer management itself. However, some
support of the familiar standard Oberon display look is provided by
module \code{Oberon\/}.

In the terminology of this module, a standard configuration consists
of one or several horizontally adjacent displays, where a \emph{display} is a
pair consisting of two tracks of equal height, a \emph{user track} on the
left and a \emph{system track} on the right. Note that even though no
reference to any physical monitor is made, a display is typically
associated with a monitor in reality.

This is the relevant excerpt of the definition:
\begintt
DEFINITION Oberon;
  PROCEDURE OpenDisplay (UW, SW, H: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE OpenTrack (X, W: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE DisplayWidth (X: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE DisplayHeight (X: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE UserTrack (X: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE SystemTrack (X: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE AllocateUserViewer (DX: INTEGER; VAR X, Y: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE AllocateSystemViewer (DX: INTEGER; VAR X, Y: INTEGER);
END Oberon.
\endtt

\noindent Procedure \code{OpenDisplay\/} initializes and opens a new display of the
dimensions \code{H\/} (height), \code{UW\/} (width of user track), and \code{SW\/} (width of
system track). Procedure \code{OpenTrack\/} overlays the sequence of existing
tracks spanned by the segment $[\code{X}, \code{X} + \code{W})$ by a new track. Both
procedure \code{OpenDisplay\/} and \code{OpenTrack\/} take from the client the burden
of creating a filler viewer.

The next group of procedures \code{DisplayWidth\/}, \code{DisplayHeight\/},
\code{UserTrack\/} and \code{SystemTrack\/} return
width or height of the respective structural entity located at
position \code{X} in the display area.

Procedures \code{AllocateUserViewer\/} and \code{AllocateSystemViewer\/} make proposals
for the allocation of a new viewer in the desired track of the display
located at \code{DX\/}. In first priority, the location is determined by the
system pointer that can be set manually. If the pointer is not set, a
location is calculated on the basis of some heuristics whose
strategies rely on different splitting fractions that are applied in
the user track and in the system track respectively, with the aim of
generating aesthetically satisfactory layouts.

In addition to the programming interface provided by module \code{Oberon\/} for
the case of standard display layouts, the display management section
in the \code{System\/} toolbox provides a user interface:
\begintt
DEFINITION System; (*Display management*)
  PROCEDURE Open; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Close; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE CloseTrack;
  PROCEDURE Recall; (*most recently closed viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Copy; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Grow; (*viewer*)
  PROCEDURE Clear; (*clear system log*)
END System.
\endtt

\noindent In turn, these commands are called to open a text viewer in
the system track, close a viewer, close a track, recall (and reopen)
the most recently closed viewer, copy a viewer, and grow a viewer. The
commands \code{Close\/}, \code{CloseTrack\/}, \code{Recall\/}, \code{Copy\/},
and \code{Grow\/} are generic. \code{Close\/}, \code{Copy\/},
and \code{Grow\/} are typically included in the title bar of a menu
viewer. Their detailed implementations follow subsequently.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 5: THE TEXT SYSTEM.

At the beginning of the computing era, text was the only medium
mediating information between users and computers. Not only was a
textual notation used to denote all kinds of data and objects via
names and numbers (represented by sequences of characters and digits
respectively), but also for the specification of programs (based on
the notions of formal language and syntax) and tasks. Actually, not
even the most modern and most sophisticated computing environments
have been able to make falter the dominating role of text
substantially. At most, they have introduced alternative models like
graphical user interfaces (\acro{GUI}) as a graphical replacement for command
lines.

There are many reasons for the popularity of text in general and in
connection with computers in particular. To name but a few: Text
containing any arbitrary amount of information can be built from a
small alphabet of widely standardized elements (characters), their
building pattern is extremely simple (lining up elements), and the
resulting structure is most elementary (a sequence). And perhaps most
importantly, syntactically structured text can be parsed and
interpreted by a machine.

In computing terminology, sequences of elements are called files and,
in particular, sequences of characters are known as text
files. Looking at their binary representation, we find text files
excellently suited to be stored in computer memories and on external
media. Remember that individual characters are usually encoded in one
byte each (\acro{ASCII}-code). We can therefore identify the binary structure
of text files with sequences of bytes, matching perfectly the
structure of any underlying computer storage. We should recall at this
point that, with the possible exception of line-break control
characters, rendering information is not part of ordinary text
files. For example, the choices of character style and of paragraph
formatting parameters are entirely left to the rendering interpreter.

Unfortunately, in conventional computing environments, text is merely
used for input/output, and its potential is not nearly exploited
optimally. Input texts are typically read from the keyboard under
control of some text editor, interpreted and then discarded. Output
text is volatile. Once displayed on the screen it is no longer
available to any other parts of the program. The root of the problem
is easily located: Conventional operating systems neither feature an
integrated management nor an abstract programming interface (\acro{API}) for
texts.

Of course, such poor support of text on the level of programming must
reflect itself on the user surface. More often than not, users are
forced to retype a certain piece of text instead of simply
copy/pasting it from elsewhere on the screen. Investigations have
shown that, in average, up to 80\% of required input text is already
displayed somewhere.

Motivated by our positive experience with integrated text in the Cedar
system \footnote{{\mc[1]}}{W. Teitelman, "A tour through Cedar", IEEE Software, 1, (2), 44-73 (1984).} we decided to provide a central text management in
Oberon at a sufficiently low system level. However, this is not
enough. We actually need an abstract programming interface (\acro{API}) for
text that is, an \emph{abstract data type} \code{Text}, together with a complete set
of operations. We shall devote Section 5.1 to the explanation of this
data type. In Section 5.2, we take a closer look at the basic text
management in Oberon, including data structures and algorithms used
for the implementation of type \code{Text}.

Text frames are a special class of display frames. They appear
typically (but not necessarily) as frames within a menu viewer (see
Section 4.4.2). Their role is double-faced: a) Rendering text on the
display screen and b) interpreting interactive editing commands. The
details will be discussed in Section 5.3.

With the aim of exploiting the power of modern bitmap-displays and
also of reusing the results of earlier projects in the field of
digital font design, we decided in favor of supporting ``rich texts'' in
Oberon, including graphical attributes and in particular font
specification. In Section 5.4 we shall explain the font machinery,
starting from an abstract level and proceeding down to the level of
raster data.

\beginsubsection 5.1. TEXT AS AN ABSTRACT DATA TYPE.

The concept of abstraction is arguably the most important achievement
of programming language development. It provides a powerful tool to
create simplified views of complicated things and connections. Two
prominent examples of program abstractions are \emph{definitions}
(\emph{interfaces}) and \emph{abstract data types}, embodying simplified views on a certain piece of program and on a certain kind of data respectively.

We shall now give a precise definition of the notion of text in Oberon
by presenting it as an abstract data type. It is important not to
confuse this type with the far less powerful type \code{String} as it is
often supported by advanced programming languages. In this Section we
carefully avoid revealing any implementation aspects of the abstract
type \code{Text}. Our viewpoint is that of an application program operating on text abstractly or using it as a medium of communication.

Nevertheless, let us first use a symbolic looking glass to get a
refined understanding of the concept of character in the context of
rich texts. We know that each character represents a textual element
of information. If displayed, it also refers to some specific
graphical pattern, often called glyph. In Oberon, we do justice to
both aspects by thinking of the \acro{ASCII}-code as an index into a font
that is into a set of glyphs of the same style. Representing
characters as pairs (\code{font}, \code{ref}), where \code{font} designates a font and \code{ref}
the character's \acro{ASCII}-code and adding two more attributes color and
vertical offset, we get to a quadruple representation (\code{font}, \code{ref}, \code{col}, \code{voff}) of characters. The components font, color, and vertical offset together are often referred to as looks. With that, we can now define a (rich) text as a sequence of characters with looks. We shall treat the topic of fonts and glyphs thoroughly in Section 5.4.

For the moment, however, let us continue our discussion of the
abstract data type \code{Text}. Formally, we define it as
\begintt
Text = POINTER TO TextDesc;
TextDesc = RECORD
  len: INTEGER;
  notify: Notifier
END;
\endtt

\noindent There is only one state variable and one method. The variable \code{len} represents the current length of the described text (i.e. the number
of characters in the sequence). The procedure variable \code{notify} is
included as a method (occasionally called after-method) to notify
interested clients of state changes.

By definition, each abstract data type comes with a complete set of
operations. In the case of \code{Text}, three different groups corresponding
to three different topics need to be considered, loading (from file),
storing (to file), editing, and accessing (reading and writing)
respectively.

\beginsubsubsection 5.1.1. Loading and Storing Text.

Let us start with the file group. We first introduce a pair of
mutually inverse operations called internalize and externalize. Their
meaning is ``load from file and build up an internal data structure''
and ``serialize the internal data structure and store it on file''
respectively. There are three corresponding procedures:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Open (T: Text; name: ARRAY OF CHAR);
PROCEDURE Load (T: Text; f: Files.File; pos: INTEGER; VAR len: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Store (T: Text; f: Files.File; pos: INTEGER; VAR len: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent Logical entities like texts are stored in Oberon on external media in the form of \emph{sections}. A section is addressed by a pair (\code{file}, \code{pos}) consisting of a file descriptor and a starting position. In general, the structure of sections obeys the following syntax:
\begintt
section = identification type length contents.
\endtt

\noindent Procedure \code{Open} internalizes a named text file (consisting of a single text section), procedure \code{Load} internalizes an arbitrary text section starting at (\code{f}, \code{pos}), and procedure \code{Store} externalizes a text section to (\code{f}, \code{pos}). The parameter \code{T} designates the internalized text. \code{len} returns the length of the section. Note that in case of \code{Load} the identification of the section must have been read and consumed before the loader is called.

\beginsubsubsection 5.1.2. Editing Text.

Our next group of operations supports text editing. It comprises four procedures:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Delete (T: Text; beg, end: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Insert (T: Text; pos: INTEGER; B: Buffer);
PROCEDURE Append (T: Text; B: Buffer);
PROCEDURE ChangeLooks (T: Text; beg, end: INTEGER;
              sel: SET; fnt: Fonts.Font; col, voff: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent Again, we should first explain the types of parameters. Procedures
\code{Delete} and \code{ChangeLooks} each take a stretch of text as an argument which, by definition, is an interval $[\code{beg}, \code{end})$ within the given text. In the parameter lists of \code{Insert} and \code{Append} we recognize a new data type \code{Buffer}.

Buffers are a facility to hold anonymous sequences of characters. Type
\code{Buffer} presents itself again as an abstract data type:
\begintt  
Buffer = POINTER TO BufDesc;
BufDesc = RECORD
  len: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent \code{len} specifies the current length of the buffered sequence. The following procedures represent the intrinsic operations on buffers:
\begintt
PROCEDURE OpenBuf (B: Buffer);
PROCEDURE Copy (SB, DB: Buffer);
PROCEDURE Save (T: Text; beg, end: INTEGER; B: Buffer);
\endtt

\noindent Their function is in turn opening a given buffer \code{B\/}, copying a buffer \code{SB} to \code{DB}, saving a stretch $[\code{beg}, \code{end})$ of text in a given buffer, and recalling the most recently deleted stretch of text and putting it into buffer \code{B}.

\code{Buffer} is used as an auxiliary data type in editing
procedures. Procedure \code{Delete} deletes the given stretch $[\code{beg}, \code{end})$
within text \code{T}, Insert inserts the buffer's contents at position pos
within text \code{T}, and \code{Append(T, B)} is a shorthand form for \code{Insert(T, T.len, B)}. Note that, as a side-effect of \code{Insert} and \code{Append}, the buffer involved is emptied. Finally, procedure \code{ChangeLooks} allows to change selected looks within the given stretch $[\code{beg}, \code{end})$ of text
\code{T}. \code{sel} is a mask selecting a subset of the set of looks
$\{$ font, color, vertical offset $\}$.

It is time now to come back to the notifier concept. Recapitulate that
\code{notify} is an ``after-method''. It must be installed by the client when opening the text and is called at the end of every editing operation. Its signature is
\begintt
Notifier = PROCEDURE (T: Text; op, beg, end: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent The parameters \code{op}, \code{beg}, and \code{end} report about the operation (\code{op}) that
calls the notifier and on the affected stretch $[\code{beg}, \code{end})$ of the text. There are three different possible variants of \code{op}
corresponding to the three different editing operations: \code{op} =
\code{delete}, \code{insert}, \code{replace} correspond to procedures \code{Delete}, \code{Insert\/} (and \code{Append\/}), and \code{ChangeLooks\/} respectively.

By far the most important application of the notifier is updating the
display, i.e. adjusting all affected views of the text that are
currently displayed to the new state of the text (the model). We shall
come back to this important matter when discussing text frames in
Section 5.3.

In concluding this Section it is worth noting that the groups of
operations just discussed have been designed to be equally useful for
interactive text editors as for programmed text
generators/manipulators.

\beginsubsubsection 5.1.3. Accessing Text.

Let us now turn to the third and last group of operations on texts:
Accessing that is reading and writing. According to the principle of
separation of concerns, one of our guiding principles, the access
mechanism operates on extra aggregates called readers and writers
rather than on texts themselves.

Readers are used to read texts sequentially. Their type is declared as
\begintt
Reader = RECORD
  eot: BOOLEAN; (*end of text*)
  fnt: Fonts.Font;
  col, voff: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent A reader must first be opened at the desired position in the text
before it can then be moved forward incrementally by reading
character-by-character. Its state variables indicate end-of-text and
expose the looks of the character last read.

The corresponding operators are
\begintt
PROCEDURE OpenReader (VAR R: Reader; T: Text; pos: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Read (VAR R: Reader; VAR ch: CHAR);
\endtt

\noindent Procedure \code{OpenReader\/} sets up a reader \code{R\/} at position \code{pos\/} in text
\code{T\/}. Procedure \code{Read\/} returns the character at the current position of \code{R\/}
and makes \code{R\/} move to the next position.

The current position of reader \code{R\/} is returned by a call to the function \code{Pos\/}:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Pos (VAR R: Reader): INTEGER;
\endtt

\noindent In Chapter 3 we learned that commands plus parameter lists are often
embedded in ordinary texts. When interpreting such commands, the
underlying text appears as a sequence of tokens like \emph{name}, \emph{number}, \emph{special symbol}, \emph{etc.} much rather than as a sequence of
characters. Therefore, we have adopted the well-known concepts of
\emph{syntax} and \emph{scanning} from the discipline of compiler construction, including functional support. The Oberon scanner recognizes tokens of
some universal classes. They are \emph{name, string, integer, real,
longreal}, and \emph{special character}.

The exact syntax of universal Oberon tokens is:
\begintt
token = name | string | integer | real | spexchar.
name = ident { "." ident }.
ident = letter { letter | digit }.
string = """ { char } """.
integer = ["+"|"-"] number.
real = ["+"|"-"] number "." number ["E" ["+"|"-"] number].
number = digit { digit }.
spexchar = any character except letters, digits, space, tab,
               and carriage-return.
\endtt

\noindent Type \code{Scanner\/} is defined correspondingly as
\begintt
Scanner = RECORD (Reader)
  nextCh: CHAR;
  line: INTEGER;
  class: INTEGER;
  i: INTEGER;
  x: REAL;
  c: CHAR;
  len: INTEGER;
  s: ARRAY 32 OF CHAR
END;
\endtt

\noindent This type is actually a variant record type with class as
discriminating tag. Depending on its \code{class} the value of the current
token is stored in one of the fields \code{i\/}\code{, x\/}\code{, c\/}\code{, or\/}\code{ s\/}. \code{len\/} gives the length of \code{s\/}, \code{nextCh\/} typically exposes the character terminating the current token, and \code{line} counts the number of lines scanned.

The operations on scanners are
\begintt
PROCEDURE OpenScanner (VAR S: Scanner; T: Text; pos: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Scan (VAR S: Scanner);
\endtt

\noindent They correspond exactly to their counterparts \code{OpenReader\/} and \code{Read\/} respectively.

Writers are dual to readers. They serve the purpose of creating and
extending texts. However, again, they do not operate on texts
directly. Rather, they act as self-contained aggregates, continuously
consuming and buffering textual data.

The formal declaration of type \code{Writer\/} resembles that of type \code{Reader\/}:
\begintt
Writer = RECORD buf:
  Buffer;
  fnt: Fonts.Font;
  col, voff: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent \code{buf} is an internal buffer containing the consumed data. \code{fnt}, \code{col}, and \code{voff} specify the current looks for the next character consumed by this writer.

The following procedures constitute the \code{Writer} \acro{API}:
\begintt
PROCEDURE OpenWriter (VAR W: Writer);
PROCEDURE SetFont (VAR W: Writer; fnt: Fonts.Font);
PROCEDURE SetColor (VAR W: Writer; col: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE SetOffset (VAR W: Writer; voff: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent Procedure \code{OpenWrite/} opens a new writer with an empty buffer. Procedures \code{SetFont}, \code{SetColor}, and \code{SetOffset} set the respective current look. For example,
\code{SetFont(W, fnt)} is equivalent with \code{W.fnt := fnt}.
These procedures are included because \code{fnt}, \code{col}, and \code{voff} are read-only for clients.

The question may arise how data is produced and transferred to
writers. The answer is a set of writer procedures, each of them
handling an individual data type:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Write (VAR W: Writer; ch: CHAR);
PROCEDURE WriteLn (VAR W: Writer);
PROCEDURE WriteString (VAR W: Writer; s: ARRAY OF CHAR);
PROCEDURE WriteInt (VAR W: Writer; x, n: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE WriteHex (VAR W: Writer; x: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE WriteReal (VAR W: Writer; x: REAL; n: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE WriteRealFix (VAR W: Writer; x: REAL; n, k: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE WriteClock(VAR W: Writer; d: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent The following is schematic fragment of a client program that creates textual output:
\begintt
open writer; set desired font;
REPEAT
  process;
  write result to writer;
  append writer buffer to output text
UNTIL ended
\endtt

\noindent Of course, writers can be reused. For example, a single global writer
is typically shared by all of the procedures within a module. In this
case, the writer needs to be opened just once at module loading time.

Typically, however, accessing aggregates are of a transient nature and
are bound to a certain activity, which manifests itself in their
allocation on the stack without any possibility of referencing them
from the outside of the activity, in contrast to the underlying texts
that are allocated on the system heap and have a much longer life
time.

Let us summarize: Text in Oberon is a powerful abstract data type with
intrinsic operations from three areas: Loading/storing, editing, and
accessing (reading/writing). The latter two areas on their part
introduce further abstract types called \code{Buffer\/}, \code{Reader\/}, \code{Scanner\/}, and
\code{Writer\/}. In combination they guarantee a clean separation of very
different concerns. The benefits of such a rigorous decoupling are
numerous. For example, it makes it possible to freely choose (and
vary) the granularity at which a text and its views are
updated. Finally, an after-method is used to allow context-dependent
post-processing of editing operations. It is used primarily for
preserving consistency between text models and their views.

\beginsubsection 5.2. TEXT MANAGEMENT.

The art and challenge of modularization lie in finding an effective decomposition of a topic into modules with relatively thin interfaces or, in other words, into modules with a great potential for information hiding. Text systems provide a welcome opportunity of an exercise. A closer analysis immediately leads to the following separate concerns corresponding to the components \code{Model}, \code{View} and \code{Controller} of the \acro{MVC} scheme: Text management, text rendering, and text editing. If we combine \code{View} and \code{Controller} and add an auxiliary font handling module \code{Fonts}, we arrive at the following three-module import hierarchy:
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
Module & Object type & Service\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
\code{TextFrames} & Frame & Text rendering and editing \cr
\code{Texts} & Text & Text management \cr
\code{Fonts} & Font & Font management \cr
}\medskip
Note that, in contrast to the display-subsystem, the associated object
types are not connected hierarchically here.

Separate Sections 5.3 and 5.4 will be devoted to modules \code{TextFrames}
and \code{Fonts} respectively. In the current Section
we focus on module \code{Texts}. Regarding it as a model of the
abstract data type \code{Text} presented in the previous Section, its
definition is congruent with the specification of the abstract data
type itself, and we need not repeat it here.

The main topics of this Section are internal representation and file
representation of texts. We first emphasize that the internal
representation of a text is a completely private matter of module
\code{Texts} that is encapsulated and hidden from clients. In particular, the representation could be changed at any time without invalidating any
single client. In principle, the same is true for the file
representation. However, stability is of paramount importance here
because files serve the additional purposes of backing up text on
external media and of porting text to other environments.

Our choice of an internal representation of text was determined by a catalogue of requirements and desired properties. The wish list looks like this:

\item{1.} lean data structure
\item{2.} closed under editing operations
\item{3.} efficient editing operations
\item{4.} efficient sequential reading
\item{5.} efficient direct positioning
\item{6.} super efficient internalizing
\item{7.} preserving file representations

\noindent With the exception of 5., we found these requirements met
perfectly by an adequately generalized variant of the piece list
technique that was originally used for Xerox \acro{PARC}'s Bravo text editor
and also for \acro{ETH}'s former document editors Dyna and Lara \footnote{{\mc[1]}}{J. Gutknecht, "Concept of the Text Editor Lara", Communications of the ACM, Sept. 1985, Vol.28, No. 9.}. The original piece list is able to describe a vanilla text without looks. It is based on two principles:

\item{1.} A text is regarded as a sequence of \emph{pieces}, where a piece is a section of a text file consisting of a sequence of contiguous characters.

\item{2.} Every piece is represented by a descriptor \code{(f, pos, len)\/}, where the components designate a file, a starting position, and a length respectively. The whole text is represented as a list of piece descriptors (in short: piece list). The editing operations operate on the piece list rather than on the pieces themselves.

\figure{pdfs/fig-5.1.png}{4.7in}{5.1}{Piece chain representing a text}

Figure 5.1 shows a typical piece list representing (the current state
of) a text. Investigating the effects of the basic editing operations
\code{delete} and \code{insert} on the piece list, we end up with these algorithms:
\begintt
delete stretch [beg, end) of text = BEGIN
  split pieces at beg and at end;
  remove piece descriptors from beg to end from the chain
END
  
insert stretch of text at pos = BEGIN
  split piece at pos;
  insert piece descriptors representing the stretch at pos
END
\endtt

\noindent Of course, splitting is superfluous if the desired splitting point
happens to coincide with the beginning of a piece. Figures 5.3 and 5.4
show the resulting piece list after a \code{delete} and an \code{insert}-operation
respectively.

\figure{pdfs/fig-5.2.png}{4.7in}{5.2}{Piece chain after delete operation}
\figure{pdfs/fig-5.3.png}{4.7in}{5.3}{Piece chain after insert operation}

Checking our wish list of above we immediately recognize the
requirements 1, 2, and 3 as met. Requirement 4 is also met
under the assumption of an efficient mechanism for direct positioning
in files. Requirement 6 can be checked off because the piece list
initially consists of a single piece spanning the entire text
file. Finally, requirement 7 is met simply because the operations do
not affect file representations at all.

In Oberon we adapted the piece list technique to texts with looks
(``rich texts''). Formally, we first define a \emph{run} as a stretch of text
whose characters show identical looks. Now, we require the piece list
to subordinate itself to the run structure. This obviously means that
every piece needs to be contained within a single run. Figure 5.4
visualizes such a compliant piece list representing a text with
varying looks. There are only two new aspects compared to the original
version of the piece list discussed above: An additional operation to
change looks and the initial state of the piece chain.
\begintt
change looks in a stretch [beg, end) of text = BEGIN
  split pieces at beg and at end;
  change looks in piece descriptors from beg to end in the chain
END
\endtt

\noindent This shows that requirements 2 and 3 in the wish list are still satisfied.

\figure{pdfs/fig-5.4.png}{4.7in}{5.4}{Generalized piece chain representing a text with looks}

Initially, the pieces are identical with runs, and the number of elements in the piece list is equal to the number of runs. Because this number is typically small in comparison with the total number of characters in a text requirement 6 is still met.

We conclude that the new aspects do not invalidate the positive rating given above to the piece technique with regard to requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 in our wish list. However, the requirement of efficient direct positioning remains. The problem is the necessity to scan through the piece list sequentially in order to locate the piece that contains the desired position. We investigated different solutions of this efficiency problem. They are based on different data structures connecting the piece descriptors, among them a piece tree and a variant of the piece list featuring an additional long-distance link like in a skip-list.

Eventually, we decided in favor of a simpler solution that we can easily justify by pointing out that the typical editing scenario is zooming into a local region of text, i.e. positioning at an arbitrary location once and subsequently positioning at locations in its immediate neighborhood many times. Therefore, an appropriate solution is caching the most recently calculated values (\code{pos}, \code{piece}) of the translation map. Of course, this does not solve the problem of cache misses. Notice, however, that this problem is acute only in the case of extremely long piece lists that do not occur in ordinary texts and editing sessions.

We shall now illustrate the piece technique in detail at the example of two important but basic operations: \code{Insert} and \code{read}. Let us start with an overview of the data types involved. Apart from some auxiliary private variables marked with an arrow, the types \code{Text}, \code{Buffer}, and \code{Reader} are already familiar to us from the previous Section. Type \code{Piece} is completely private and hidden from the clients.
\begintt
Text = POINTER TO TextDesc;

Notifier = PROCEDURE (T: Text; op, beg, end: INTEGER);

TextDesc = RECORD
  len: INTEGER;
  notify: Notifier;
|triangleright trailer: Piece;
|triangleright org: INTEGER;
|triangleright pce: Piece
END;

Buffer = POINTER TO BufDesc;
BufDesc = RECORD
  len: INTEGER;
|triangleright header, last: Piece
END;

Reader = RECORD
  eot: BOOLEAN;
  fnt: Fonts.Font;
  col, voff: INTEGER;
|triangleright ref: Piece;
|triangleright org, off: INTEGER;
  rider: Files.Rider
END;

|triangleright Piece = POINTER TO PieceDesc;
|triangleright PieceDesc = RECORD
  f: Files.File;
  off, len: INTEGER;
  fnt: Fonts.Font;
  col, voff: INTEGER;
  prev, next: Piece
END;
\endtt

\noindent As depicted in Figure 5.1, the piece list is implemented as a doubly
linked list with a sentinel piece closing it to a ring. The field
trailer in type \code{TextDesc} points to the sentinel piece. Fields \code{org} and
\code{pce} implement a translation cache consisting of merely one entry \code{(org, pce)}.
It links a position \code{org} with a piece \code{pce}. The fields \code{header} and \code{last} in type \code{Buffer} refer to the implementation of buffers as piece
lists. They point to the first and last piece descriptors
respectively. Finally, the fields \code{ref}, \code{org}, and \code{off} in type \code{Reader}
memorize the current piece, its origin, and the current offset within
this piece.

The fields \code{f}, \code{off}, and \code{len} in type \code{Piece} specify the underlying file, starting position in the file, and length of the piece. \code{fnt}, \code{col}, and \code{voff} are its looks. Finally \code{prev} and \code{next} are pointers to the previous piece and to the next piece in the list respectively.

\code{FindPiece} and \code{SplitPiece} are auxiliary procedures that are used by almost all piece-oriented operations.
\begintt
PROCEDURE FindPiece (T: Text; pos: INTEGER;
                     VAR org: INTEGER; VAR p: Piece);
  VAR p: Piece;
      porg: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  p := T.pce;
  porg := T.org;
|eightit 1|tt IF pos >= porg THEN
    WHILE pos >= porg + p.len DO INC(porg, p.len); p := p.next END
|eightit 2|tt ELSE p := p.prev; DEC(porg, p.len);
    WHILE p < porg DO p := p.prev; DEC(porg, p.len) END
  END;
|eightit 3|tt T.pce := p; R.org := porg; (*update cache*)
  pce := p; org := porg
END FindPiece;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations (referring to the line numbers in the above code excerpt)

\item{1} search to the right (next)
\item{2} search to the left (prev)
\item{3} update cache if more than 50 pieces traversed

\begintt
|eightit 1|tt PROCEDURE SplitPiece (p: Piece; off: INTEGER; VAR pr: Piece);
VAR q: Piece;
BEGIN
|eightit 2|tt IF off > 0 THEN
     NEW(q);
     q.fnt := p.fnt;
     q.col := p.col;
     q.voff := p.voff;
     q.len := p.len - off;
     q.f := p.f;
     q.off := p.off + off;
     p.len := off;
|eightit 3|tt   q.next := p.next; p.next := q;
|eightit 4|tt   q.prev := p; q.next.prev := q;
     pr := q
   ELSE pr := p
   END
END SplitPiece;
\endtt
\noindent Explanations:

\item{1} return right part piece pr after split
\item{2} generate new piece only if remaining length > 0
\item{3} insert new piece in forward chain
\item{4} insert new piece in backward chain

\noindent Procedure \code{Insert} handles text insertion. It operates on a buffer that contains the stretch of text to be inserted:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Insert (T: Text; pos: INTEGER; B: Buffer);
  VAR pl, pr, p, qb, qe: Piece;
  org, end: INTEGER;
BEGIN
|eightit 1|tt FindPiece(T, pos, org, p); SplitPiece(p, pos - org, pr);
|eightit 2|tt IF T.org >= org THEN
    T.org := org - p.prev.len;
    T.pce := p.prev
  END;
  pl := pr.prev;
  qb := B.header.next;
|eightit 3|tt IF (qb # NIL) & (qb.f = pl.f) & (qb.off = pl.off + pl.len)
      & (qb.fnt = pl.fnt) & (qb.col = pl.col) & (qb.voff = pl.voff) THEN
    pl.len := pl.len + qb.len; qb := qb.next
  END;
  IF qb # NIL THEN
    qe := B.last;
|eightit 4|tt qb.prev := pl; pl.next := qb; qe.next := pr; pr.prev := qe
  END;
|eightit 5|tt T.len := T.len + B.len; end := pos + B.len;
|eightit 6|tt B.last := B.header; B.last.next := NIL; B.len := 0;
|eightit 7|tt T.notify(T, insert, pos, end)
END Insert;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:

\item{1} split piece to isolate point of insertion
\item{2} adjust cache if necessary
\item{3} merge pieces if possible
\item{4} insert buffer
\item{5} update text length
\item{6} empty buffer
\item{7} notify

\noindent Procedure \code{Read} implements sequential reading of characters in texts. It operates on a text reader:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Read (VAR R: Reader; VAR ch: CHAR);
BEGIN
|eightit 1|tt Files.Read(R.rider, ch);
  R.fnt := R.ref.fnt;
  R.col := R.ref.col;
  R.voff := R.ref.voff;
  INC(R.off);
|eightit 2|tt IF R.off = R.ref.len THEN
|eightit 3|tt   IF R.ref.f = WFile THEN R.eot := TRUE END;
    R.org := R.org + R.off; R.off := 0;
|eightit 4|tt   R.ref := R.ref.next; R.org := R.org + R.off; R.off := 0;
|eightit 5|tt   Files.Set(R.rider, R.ref.f, R.ref.off)
  END
END Read;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:

\item{1} read character from file and update looks in reader
\item{2} if piece boundary reached
\item{3} check if sentinel piece reached
\item{4} move reader to next piece
\item{5} position file rider

\noindent Procedure \code{Read} is typically used as a primitive by text scanners and in particular by the built-in scanner \code{Scan} for the recognition of universal tokens, as they were defined in the previous section. Scanning is a rather complex operation that, for example, includes the conversion of a sequence of digits into an internal floating-point representation and vice-versa. Scanning a real number involves recognizing $m$ and $d$, and computing $x = m \times 10^d$. This is done using procedure \code{Ten(d)} computing $10^d$ by repeated multiplication maintaining the invariant $t \times p^n = 10^{n_0}$, where $n_0$ is the initial value of $n$.
\begintt
PROCEDURE Ten(n: INTEGER): REAL;
  VAR t, p: REAL;
BEGIN
  t := 1.0;
  p := 10.0;
  WHILE n > 0 DO
    IF ODD(n) THEN t := p * t END ;
    p := p*p;
    n := n DIV 2
  END ;
  RETURN t
END Ten;
\endtt

\noindent Writing a real number in decimal form is more complicated. It involves the computation of $m$ and $d$ from $x = n \times 2^e$ so that $x = m \times 10^d$ with $1.0 \le m < 10.0$. First, $e$ is obtained with the standard function \code{UNPK(x, e)}, then $d$ is computed (from the relationship
$10^k = 2^{k*log(10)}$) as $d = e \div log_2(10)$.
In order to avoid a real division for obtaining $d$,
we use the approximation $1.0 \div log_2(10) $~\approx~\code{77 DIV 256},
and then compute
\code{x := x / Ten(e)} or \code{x := x * Ten(-e)}.
Further details are to be taken from the listings of \code{WriteReal} and \code{WriteRealFix}.

In spite of its apparent simplicity the piece list technique interoperates with other system components in quite a subtle way. For example, after a while of editing, there are typically numerous cross references between the documents involved. In other words, pieces of one document may point to foreign files that is to files that were originally associated with other documents. As a consequence, the file system must either employ some smart garbage collection algorithm or not recycle file pages at all, even if a new version of a file of the same name has been created in the meantime.

A problem of another kind, again affecting the file system, arises if, say, a single text line is composed of several small pieces. Then, reading this line sequentially may necessitate several jumps to different positions in different files at a high pace. Depending on the quality of the file buffering mechanism, this may lead to significantly hesitant mouse tracking.

And finally, typed characters that are supposed to be inserted into a text need to be stored on the so-called \emph{keyboard file}. For this (continuously growing) file, several readers and one writer must be allowed to coexist concurrently.

As a consequence, the following qualities of the underlying file system are mandatory for the piece technique to work properly:

\item{1.} Once a file page is allocated it must not be reused (until system restart).
\item{2.} A versatile file buffering mechanism supporting multiple buffers per file is required.
\item{3.} Files must be allowed to be open in read mode and in write mode simultaneously.

\noindent The format of text sections in files obeys a set of syntactical rules (productions) that can easily be specified in \acro{EBNF}-notation:
\begintt
TextSection = ident header {char}.
header = type offset run {run} null length.
run = font [name] color offset length.
\endtt

\noindent In the \code{TextSection} production \code{ident} is an identifier for text blocks. In the header production \code{type} is a type-discriminator, \code{offset} is the offset to the character part, \code{run} is a run-descriptor, \code{null} is a null-character, and \code{length} is the length of the character sequence. In the \code{run} production \code{font}, \code{color}, and \code{offset} are specifications of looks, and \code{length} is the run-length. In order to save space, font names are coded as ordinal numbers within a text section. If and only if a font appears for the first time in a text block it is followed by the actual font name.

Let us conclude this Section with two side-remarks and a summary.

\noindent Remarks:

{ \narrower

For compatibility reasons, plain \acro{ASCII}-files are accepted as text files as well. They are mapped to texts consisting of a single run with standard looks.

Internalizing a text section from a file is extremely efficient because it is obviously sufficient to read the header and translate it into the initial state of the piece list.

}

\noindent Summary: The mechanism used for the implementation of the abstract data type \code{Text} is completely hidden from clients. It is a generalized version of the original piece list technique, adapted to texts with looks. The piece list technique in turn is based on the principle of indirection: Operations operate on descriptors of texts rather than on texts themselves. The benefits are efficiency and non-destructive operations. However, the technique works properly only in combination with an efficient (and reliable) garbage collector and a suitable file system.

\beginsubsection 5.3. TEXT FRAMES.

The tasks of text frames are text rendering and user interaction. A text frame represents a text view and a controller in the form of an interactive text editor. Technically, text frames are a subclass of display frames and, as such, are objects with an open message interface of the kind explained in Chapter 4.

The geometric layout of text frames is determined by two areas: A rectangle of contents and a vertical scroll-bar along the left borderline. The type of text frames is a direct extension of type \code{Display.Frame}:
\begintt
Frame = POINTER TO FrameDesc;
FrameDesc = RECORD (Display.FrameDesc)
  text: Texts.Text;
  org, col, lsp: INTEGER;
  left, right, top, bot: INTEGER;
  markH, time: INTEGER;
  hasCar, hasSel, hasMark: BOOLEAN;
  carloc: Location;
  selbeg, selend: Location
END;
\endtt

\noindent Fields \code{text} and \code{org} specify the text part to be displayed, the former referring to the underlying text and the latter designating the starting position of the displayed part. Fields \code{col} and \code{lsp} are rendering parameters. They specify the frame's background color and the line spacing. Fields \code{left}, \code{right}, \code{top}, and \code{bot} are margins. They determine the rectangle of contents. \code{mark} indicates whether there is a position marker, which is a small horizontal bar indicating the position of the displayed part relative to the whole text. \code{markH} represents its location within the text frame.

\emph{Caret} and \emph{selection} are two important features associated with a text frame. The caret indicates a focus, and it serves as an implicit ``point of insertion'' for placing consumed characters (for example from the keyboard). The selection is a stretch of displayed text. Additionally it serves as a parameter for various operations and commands, among them delete and change looks. The state and location of the caret is given by the variables \code{car} and \code{carloc} respectively. Analogously, the state of the selection and its begin and end are reflected by the fields \code{sel}, \code{selbeg}, and \code{selend} in the frame descriptor. Field \code{time} is a time stamp on the current selection.

In principle, caret and selection could be regarded as ingredients of the underlying text (the model) equally well. However, we deliberately decided to associate these features with frames (views) in order to get increased flexibility. For example, two different selections in adjacent viewers displaying the same text are normally interpreted as one extensive selection across their span.

The auxiliary type \code{Location} summarizes information about a location in a text frame. Its definition is:
\begintt
Location = RECORD
  org, pos, dx, x, y: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent \code{x}, \code{y} specify the envisioned location relative to the text frame's origin, and \code{dx} is the width of the character at this location. \code{pos} is the corresponding position in the text and \code{org} is the origin position of the corresponding text line.

The following is a simplified version of the message handler employed by text frames. It fully determines the behavior and capabilities of text frames.
\begintt
PROCEDURE Handle* (F: Display.Frame; VAR M: Display.FrameMsg);
  VAR F1: Frame;
  buf: Texts.Buffer;
BEGIN
  CASE M OF
  Oberon.InputMsg:
|eightit 1|tt    IF M.id = Oberon.track THEN Edit(F(Frame), M.X, M.Y, M.keys)
    ELSIF M.id = Oberon.consume THEN
|eightit 2|tt    IF F(Frame).hasCar THEN Write(F(Frame), M.ch, M.fnt, M.col, M.voff)
    END END |mid
  Oberon.ControlMsg:
|eightit 3|tt    IF M.id = Oberon.defocus THEN Defocus(F(Frame))
|eightit 4|tt    ELSIF M.id = Oberon.neutralize THEN Neutralize(F(Frame))
    END |mid
|eightit 5|tt  Oberon.SelectionMsg:
    GetSelection(F(Frame), M.text, M.beg, M.end, M.time) |mid
|eightit 6|tt  Oberon.CopyMsg:
    Copy(F(Frame), F1); M.F := F1 |mid
|eightit 7|tt  MenuViewers.ModifyMsg:
    Modify(F(Frame), M.id, M.dY, M.Y, M.H) |mid
|eightit 8|tt  CopyOverMsg:
    CopyOver(F(Frame), M.text, M.beg, M.end) |mid
|eightit 9|tt  UpdateMsg:
    IF F(Frame).text = M.text THEN Update(F(Frame), M) END
  END
END Handle;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations: % NOTE: This was wrong in the 2013 text, I reordered the numbers and added 6 back in. 

\item{1} Mouse tracking message: Call built-in editor immediately
\item{2} Consume message: In case of valid caret insert character
\item{3} Defocus message: Remove caret
\item{4} Neutralize message: Remove caret and selection
\item{5} Selection message: Return current selection with time stamp
\item{6} Copy message: Create a copy (clone)
\item{7} Modify message: Translate and change size
\item{8} Copyover message: Copy given stretch of text to caret
\item{9} Update message: If text was changed then update display

\noindent We recognize again our categories of universal messages introduced in Chapter 4, Table 4.6: Messages in lines 1 and 2 report about user interactions. Messages in 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 specify generic operations. Messages in 7 require a change of location or size. Messages of the latter kind arrive from the ancestor menu viewer via delegation. They are generated by the interaction handler and preprocessed by the original viewer message handler. Finally, messages in line 9 report about changes of contents.

The text frame handler is encapsulated in a module called \code{TextFrames}. This module exports the above introduced types \code{Frame} (text frame) and \code{Location}, as well as the procedure \code{Handle}. Furthermore, it exports type \code{UpdateMsg} to report on changes made to a displayable text.
\begintt
UpdateMsg = RECORD (Display.FrameMsg)
  id: INTEGER;
  text: Texts.Text;
  beg, end: INTEGER
END;
\endtt

\noindent Field \code{id} names one of the operators \code{replace}, \code{insert}, or \code{delete}. The remaining fields \code{text}, \code{beg}, and \code{end} restrict the change to a range. Additional procedures generate a new standard menu text frame and contents text frame respectively:
\begintt
PROCEDURE NewMenu (name, commands: ARRAY OF CHAR): Frame;
PROCEDURE NewText (text: Texts.Text; pos: INTEGER): Frame;
\endtt

\noindent This completes the minimum definition of module \code{TextFrames}. In addition, this module exports a set of useful service procedures supporting the composition of custom handlers from elements of the standard handler:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Edit (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; Keys: SET);
PROCEDURE Write (F: Frame; ch: CHAR; fnt: Fonts.Font;
                 col, voff: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Defocus (F: Frame);
PROCEDURE Neutralize (F: Frame);
PROCEDURE GetSelection (F: Frame; VAR text: Texts.Text;
                        VAR beg, end, time: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE CopyOver (F: Frame; text: Texts.Text; beg, end: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Copy (F: Frame; VAR F1: Frame);
PROCEDURE Modify (F: Frame; id, dY, Y, H: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Update (F: Frame; VAR M: UpdateMsg);
\endtt

\noindent The module also supports mouse tracking inside text frames:
\begintt
PROCEDURE TrackCaret (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; VAR keysum: SET);
PROCEDURE TrackSelection (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; VAR keysum: SET);
PROCEDURE TrackLine (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; VAR org: INTEGER; VAR keysum: SET);
PROCEDURE TrackWord (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; VAR pos: INTEGER; VAR keysum: SET);
\endtt

\noindent Let us now take a closer look at the implementation of some selected operations. For this purpose, we must first explain the notion of line descriptor that is used to optimize the operation of locating positions within text frames.
\begintt
Line = POINTER TO LineDesc;

LineDesc = RECORD
  len, wid: INTEGER;
  eot: BOOLEAN;
  next: Line
END;
\endtt

\noindent Each line descriptor provides detailed information about a single line of text that is currently displayed: \code{len} is the number of characters on the line, \code{wid} is the line width, \code{eot} indicates terminating line, and \code{next} points to the next line descriptor.

Text frames maintain a private data structure called \emph{line list} that describes the list of text lines displayed:
\begintt
Frame = POINTER TO FrameDesc;

FrameDesc = RECORD (Display.FrameDesc)
  text: Texts.Text;
  org, col, lsp: INTEGER;
  left, right, top, bot: INTEGER;
  markH, time: INTEGER;
  hasChar, hasSel, hasMark: BOOLEAN;
  carloc, selbeg, selend: Location;
|triangleright trailer: Line
END;
\endtt

\noindent Field \code{trailer} represents a sentinel element that closes the line list to a ring.

The line list contains useful summary information about the current contents of the text frame. It can be used beneficially by some related data types, for example by type \code{Location} that was introduced earlier:
\begintt
Location = RECORD
  org, pos, dx, x, y: INTEGER;
|triangleright lin: Line
END;
\endtt

\noindent The built-in editor procedure \code{Edit} is a worthwhile part to look at in more detail. It is called by the task scheduler to handle mouse events within a text frame. The following code excerpt shows nicely how the different components of the text system interoperate.
\begintt
PROCEDURE Edit* (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; Keys: SET);
VAR M: CopyOverMsg;
    text: Texts.Text;
    buf: Texts.Buffer;
    v: Viewers.Viewer;
    loc0, loc1: Location;
    beg, end, time, pos: INTEGER; keysum: SET;
    fnt: Fonts.Font;
    col, voff: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  IF X < F.X + Min(F.left, barW) THEN (*cursor is in scroll bar*)
    Oberon.DrawMouse(ScrollMarker, X, Y);
    keysum := Keys;
    IF Keys = {2} THEN (*ML, scroll up*)
      TrackLine(F, X, Y, pos, keysum);
      IF (pos >= 0) & (keysum = {2}) THEN
        RemoveMarks(F); Oberon.RemoveMarks(F.X, F.Y, F.W, F.H);
          Show(F, pos)
      END
    ELSIF Keys = {1} THEN (*MM*)
      keysum := Keys;
      REPEAT Input.Mouse(Keys, X, Y); keysum := keysum + Keys;
        Oberon.DrawMouse(ScrollMarker, X, Y)
      UNTIL Keys = {};
      IF ~(keysum = {0, 1, 2}) THEN
        IF 0 IN keysum THEN pos := 0
        ELSIF 2 IN keysum THEN pos := F.text.len - 100
        ELSE pos := (F.Y + F.H - Y) * (F.text.len) DIV F.H
        END ;
        RemoveMarks(F); Oberon.RemoveMarks(F.X, F.Y, F.W, F.H);
        Show(F, pos)
      END
    ELSIF Keys = {0} THEN (*MR, scroll down*)
      TrackLine(F, X, Y, pos, keysum);
      IF keysum = {0} THEN
        LocateLine(F, Y, loc0); LocateLine(F, F.Y, loc1);
        pos := F.org - loc1.org + loc0.org;
        IF pos < 0 THEN pos := 0 END ;
        RemoveMarks(F); Oberon.RemoveMarks(F.X, F.Y, F.W, F.H);
        Show(F, pos)
      END
    END
  ELSE (*cursor is in text area*)

\noindent We see that the editing operation is determined by the first key pressed (primary key) and can then be varied by ``interclicking'' that is, by clicking a secondary key while holding down the primary key. As a convention, (inter)clicking all keys means cancelling the operation. Mouse clicks and subsequent actions can now be summarized as follows:
\medskip
\noindent 1. In the scroll bar

\medskip
\noindent Let us ``zoom into'' one of the editing operations,
for example into \code{TrackCaret}.
\begintt
PROCEDURE TrackCaret (F: Frame; X, Y: INTEGER; VAR keysum: SET);
VAR loc: Location; keys: SET;
BEGIN
|eightit 1|tt IF F.trailer.next # F.trailer THEN
|eightit 2|tt   LocateChar(F, X - F.X, Y - F.Y, F.carloc);
|eightit 3|tt   FlipCaret(F);
|eightit 4|tt   keysum := {};
    REPEAT
      Input.Mouse(keys, X, Y); keysum := keysum + keys;
      Oberon.DrawMouseArrow(X, Y);
      LocateChar(F, X - F.X, Y - F.Y, loc);
      IF loc.pos # F.carloc.pos THEN
        FlipCaret(F);
        F.carloc := loc;
        FlipCaret(F)
      END
|eightit 5|tt  UNTIL keys = {};
|eightit 6|tt  F.hascar := TRUE
  END
END TrackCaret;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:

\item{1} guard guarantees non-empty line list
\item{2} locates the character pointed at
\item{3} drags caret to new location
\item{4--5} tracks mouse and drags caret accordingly
\item{6} set caret state

\noindent\code{TrackCaret} makes use of two auxiliary procedures \code{FlipCaret} and \code{LocateChar}. \code{FlipCaret} is used to turn off or on the pattern of the caret. \code{LocateChar} is an important operation that is used to locate the character at a given Cartesian position $(x, y)$ within the frame.
\begintt
PROCEDURE FlipCaret (F: Frame);
BEGIN
|eightit 1|tt IF F.carloc.x < F.W THEN
|eightit 2|tt  IF (F.carloc.y >= 10) & (F.carloc.x + 12 < F.W) THEN
|eightit 3|tt    Display.CopyPattern(Display.white, Display.hook,
        F.X + F.carloc.x, F.Y + F.carloc.y - 8, Display.invert)
    END
  END
END FlipCaret;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:

\item{1--2} if there is room for drawing the caret
\item{3} copy standard hook-shaped pattern to caret location in inverse video mode
\begintt
PROCEDURE LocateChar (F: Frame; x, y: INTEGER; VAR loc: Location);
VAR R: Texts.Reader;
    patadr, pos, lim: INTEGER;
    ox, dx, u, v, w, h: INTEGER;
BEGIN
|eightit 1|tt LocateLine(F, y, loc);
|eightit 2|tt lim := loc.org + loc.lin.len - 1;
|eightit 3|tt pos := loc.org; ox := F.left; dx := eolW;
|eightit 4|tt Texts.OpenReader(R, F.text, loc.org);
|eightit 5|tt WHILE pos # lim DO
|eightit 6|tt   Texts.Read(R, nextCh);
|eightit 7|tt   Fonts.GetPat(R.fnt.raster, nextCh, dx, u, v, w, h, patadr);
    IF ox + dx <= x THEN
      INC(pos); ox := ox + dx;
      IF pos = lim THEN dx := eolW END
      ELSE lim := pos
    END
  END ;
|eightit 8|tt loc.pos := pos; loc.dx := dx; loc.x := ox
END LocateChar;
\endtt
\noindent Explanations:

\item{1} locate text line corresponding to at y
\item{2} set limit to the last actual character on this line
\item{3} start locating loop with first character on this line
\item{4} setup reader and read first character of this line
\item{5--7} scan through characters of this line until limit or x is reached
\item{6} get character width dx of current character 8) return location found

Note that the need to read characters from the text (again) in \code{LocateChar} has its roots in the so-called \emph{proportional} fonts in which our rich texts are represented. We found that keeping character widths is an unnecessary optimization thanks to the buffering capabilities of the underlying file system. In the case of fixed-pitch fonts a simple division by the character width would be sufficient, of course.

Finally, procedure \code{LocateLine} uses the line list to locate the desired text line without reading text at all.
\begintt
PROCEDURE LocateLine (F: Frame; y: INTEGER; VAR loc: Location);
VAR L: Line; org, cury: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  org := F.org;
|eightit 1|tt org := F.org; L := F.trailer.next; cury := F.H - F.top - asr;
|eightit 2|tt WHILE (L.next # F.trailer) & (cury > y + dsr) DO
  org := org + L.len; L := L.next; cury := cury - lsp
|eightit 3|tt END;
|eightit 4|tt loc.org := org; loc.lin := L; loc.y := cury
END LocateLine;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:

\item{1} start with first line in the frame
\item{2--3} traverse line chain until last line or y is reached
\item{4} return found line

\noindent After text editing text, rendering is our next topic. Let us pursue the case in that a user pressed the point-key and then interclicked the middle key, corresponding to line 56 in procedure \code{Edit}. Remember that notifier is called at the end of every editing operation and in particular at the end of \code{Texts.Insert}. In case of standard text frames, the notifier simply broadcasts an update message into the display space:
\begintt
PROCEDURE NotifyDisplay (T: Texts.Text; op, beg, end: INTEGER);
VAR M: UpdateMsg;
BEGIN
  M.id := op; M.text := T; M.beg := beg; M.end := end;
  Viewers.Broadcast(M)
END NotifyDisplay;
\endtt

\noindent Let us now take the perspective of a text frame receiving an update message. Looking at line 9 in the text frame handler, we see that procedure \code{Update} is called, which in turn calls procedure \code{Insert} in \code{TextFrames}:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Insert (F: Frame; beg, end: INTEGER);
  VAR R: Texts.Reader;
      L, L0, l: Line;
      org, len, curY, botY, Y0, Y1, Y2, dY, wid: INTEGER;
BEGIN
  IF beg < F.org THEN F.org := F.org + (end - beg)
  ELSE
|eightit 1|tt   org := F.org; L := F.trailer.next; curY := F.Y + F.H - F.top - asr;
    WHILE (L # F.trailer) & (org + L.len <= beg) DO
      org := org + L.len; L := L.next; curY := curY - lsp
|eightit 2|tt    END;
|eightit 3|tt    IF L # F.trailer THEN
      botY := F.Y + F.bot + dsr;
|eightit 4|tt      Texts.OpenReader(R, F.text, org); Texts.Read(R, nextCh);
|eightit 5|tt      len := beg - org; wid := Width(R, len);
|eightit 6|tt      ReplConst (F.col, F, F.X + F.left + wid, curY - dsr, L.wid - wid, lsp, 0);
|eightit 7|tt      DisplayLine(F, L, R, F.X + F.left + wid, curY, len);
|eightit 8|tt      org := org + L.len; curY := curY - lsp;
      Y0 := curY; L0 := L.next;
      WHILE (org <= end) & (curY >= botY) DO
        NEW(l);
        Display.ReplConst(F.col, F.X + F.left, curY - dsr, F.W - F.left, lsp, 0);
        DisplayLine(F, l, R, F.X + F.left, curY, 0);
        L.next := l; L := l;
        org := org + L.len; curY := curY - lsp
|eightit 9|tt      END;
|eightit 10|tt      IF L0 # L.next THEN Y1 := curY;
|eightit 11|tt        L.next := L0;
        WHILE (L.next # F.trailer) & (curY >= botY) DO
          L := L.next; curY := curY - lsp
|eightit 12|tt        END;
        L.next := F.trailer;
        dY := Y0 - Y1;
|eightit 13|tt        IF Y1 > curY + dY THEN Display.CopyBlock
          (F.X + F.left, curY + dY + lsp - dsr, F.W - F.left, Y1 - curY - dY,
           F.X + F.left, curY + lsp - dsr,
           0);
           Y2 := Y1 - dY
        ELSE Y2 := curY
        END;
|eightit 14|tt        curY := Y1; L := L0;
        WHILE curY # Y2 DO
          Display.ReplConst(F.col, F.X + F.left, curY - dsr, F.W - F.left, lsp, 0);
          DisplayLine(F, L, R, F.X + F.left, curY, 0);
          L := L.next; curY := curY - lsp
|eightit 15|tt        END
      END
    END
  END;
|eightit 16|tt  UpdateMark(F)
END Insert;
\endtt
\noindent Some explanations:

\item{1--2} search line where inserted part starts
\item{3} if it is displayed in this viewer
\item{4} setup reader on this line
\item{5} get width of unaffected part of line (avoid touching it)
\item{6} clear remaining part of line
\item{7} display new remaining part of line
\item{8--9} display newly inserted text lines
\item{10} if it was not a one line update
\item{11--12} skip overwritten text lines
\item{13} use fast block move to adjust reusable lines
\item{14--15} redisplay previously overwritten text lines
\item{16} adjust position marker

\noindent Special care needs to be exercised in the implementation to avoid ``flickering'' and to minimize processing time. Concretely, the following measures are taken for this purpose:

\item{1.} Avoid writing the same data again.
\item{2.} Keep the number of newly rendered text lines at a minimum.
\item{3.} Use raster operations (block moves) to adjust reusable displayed lines.

\noindent Of course, the rules governing the rendering and formatting process crucially influence the complexity of procedures like \code{Insert}. For text frames we have consciously chosen the simplest possible set of formatting rules. They can be summarized as:

\item{1.} For a given text frame the distance between lines is constant.
\item{2.} There are no implicit line breaks.

\noindent It is exactly this set of rules that makes it possible to display a text line in one pass. Two passes are inevitable if line distances have to adjust to font sizes or if lines must be broken implicitly.

Updating algorithms make use of the following one-pass rendering procedures \code{Width} and \code{DisplayLine}:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Width (VAR R: Texts.Reader; len: INTEGER): INTEGER;
  VAR patadr, pos, ox, dx, x, y, w, h: INTEGER;
|eightit 1|tt BEGIN pos:=0; ox:=0;
    WHILE pos < len DO
      Fonts.GetPat(R.fnt, nextCh, dx, x, y, w, h, pat);
      ox := ox + dx; INC(pos); Texts.Read(R, nextCh)
|eightit 2|tt  END;
|eightit 3|tt  RETURN ox
END Width;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:

\item{1--2} scan through len characters of this line
\item{3} return accumulated width

\noindent Procedures \code{Width} and \code{LocateChar} are similar. Therefore the above comment about relying on the buffering capabilities of the underlying file system applies to procedure Width equally well.

{\bf TODO:} This function is definitely different in the source. Need to figure out what happened.
\begintt
PROCEDURE DisplayLine (F: Frame; L: Line;
                       VAR R: Texts.Reader;
                       X, Y, len: INTEGER);
  VAR patadr, NX, Xlim, dx, x, y, w, h: INTEGER;
BEGIN
|eightit 1|tt  NX := F.X + F.W;  Xlim := NX - 40;
|eightit 2|tt  WHILE (nextCh # CR) & ((nextCh > " ") OR (X < Xlim)) & (R.fnt # NIL) DO
|eightit 3|tt    Fonts.GetPat(R.fnt, nextCh, dx, x, y, w, h, patadr);
|eightit 4|tt    IF (X + x + w <= NX) & (h # 0) THEN
|eightit 5|tt      Display.CopyPattern(R.col, patadr, X + x, Y + y, Display.invert)
|eightit 6|tt    END;
|eightit 7|tt    X := X + dx; INC(len); Texts.Read(R, nextCh)
|eightit 8|tt  END;
|eightit 9|tt  L.len := len + 1; L.wid := X+eolW - (F.X + F.left);
|eightit 10|tt  L.eot := R.fnt = NIL; Texts.Read(R, nextCh)
END DisplayLine;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations:
\item{1} set right margin
\item{2--8} display characters of this line
\item{3} get width dx, box x, y, w, h, and pattern address of next character
\item{4} if there is enough space in the rectangle of contents
\item{5} display pattern
\item{7} jump to location of next character; read next character
\item{9--10} setup line descriptor

\noindent Procedure \code{DisplayLine} is again similar to \code{LocateChar}, and the comment about relying on the file system’s buffering capabilities applies once more. The principal difference between \code{LocateChar} and \code{Width} on one hand and \code{DisplayLine} on the other hand is the fact that the latter accesses the display screen physically. Therefore, possession of the screen lock is a tacit precondition for calling \code{DisplayLine}.

A quick look at an auxiliary procedure that updates the position marker concludes our tour behind the scenes of the text system:
\begintt
PROCEDURE UpdateMark (F: Frame);
  VAR oldH: INTEGER;
BEGIN |eightit 1|tt  
|eightit 1|tt    oldH := F.markH; F.markH := F.org * F.H DIV (F.text.len + 1));
  IF (F.mark > 0) & (F.left >= barW) & (F.markH # oldH) THEN
|eightit 2|tt      Display.ReplConst(Display.white, F.X + 1, F.Y + F.H - 1 - oldH, markW, 1, Display.invert);
|eightit 3|tt      Display.ReplConst(Display.white, F.X + 1, F.Y + F.H - 1 - F.markH, markW, 1, Display.invert)
  END
END UpdateMark;
\endtt

\noindent Explanations

\item{1} shows how the marker's position is calculated. Loosely spoken, the invariant is distance from top of frame / frame height = text position of first character in frame / text length
\item{2} erase the old marker
\item{3} draw the new marker

\noindent And this in turn concludes our Section on text frames. Recapitulating the most important points: The tasks of text editing (input oriented) and text rendering (output oriented) are combined in the concept of text frames. Text frames constitute a subclass of display frames, and they are implemented in a separate module called \code{TextFrames}. The implementation of \code{TextFrames} accesses the displayed text exclusively via the ``official'' abstract interface of module \code{Texts} discussed in Section 5.2. It maintains a private data structure of line lists to accelerate locating requests. Text frames use simple formatting rules that allow super-efficient rendering of text in a single pass. In particular, line spacing is fixed for every text frame. Therefore, different styles of a base font are possible within a given text frame while different sizes are not.

Putting into relation the different extensions of type \code{Display.Frame} that we came across in Chapters 4 and 5, we obtain the type hierarchy as shown in Figure 5.5.

\figure{pdfs/fig-5.5.png}{4.7in}{5.5}{Extensions of type \code{Display.Frame}}

\beginsubsection 5.4. THE FONT MACHINERY.

We saw in the previous Sections that Oberon texts support attribute specifications (``looks'') for characters. Three different attributes are supported: font, color, and vertical offset. Let us first focus on the font attribute. A font can be regarded as a style the standard character set is designed in. Typically, an entire text is typeset in a single style, that is, there is one font per text. However, sometimes, an author wants to emphasize titles or words by changing the size of the font or by varying it to bold face or italics. In special texts, special characters like mathematical symbols or other kinds of icons may occur. In even more complex documents, mathematical or chemical formulae might flow within the text.

This generalized view leads us to a different interpretation of the notion of font. We can regard a font as an indexed library of (graphical) objects, mostly but not necessarily glyphs. In the case of ordinary characters it is natural to use the \acro{ASCII}-code as an index, ending up with an interpretation of text as sequence of pairs (library, index). Note that this is a very general view indeed that, in principle, is equivalent with defining text as sequence of arbitrary objects.

The imaging model of characters provides two levels of abstraction. On the first level, characters are black boxes specified by a set of metric data $x$, $y$, $w$, $h$, and $dx$. $(x, y)$ is a vector from the current point of reference on the base line to the origin of the box. $w$ and $h$ are width and height of the box, and $dx$ is the distance to the point of reference of the next character on the same base line. On the second level of abstraction, a character is defined by a digital pattern or glyph that is to be rendered into the box. Figure 5.6 visualizes this model of characters.

The additional two character attributes color and vertical offset appear now as parameters for the character model. The vertical offset allows translating the glyph vertically and the color attribute specifies the foreground color of the pattern.

\figure{pdfs/fig-5.6.png}{3.0in}{5.6}{The geometric character model}

Good examples of procedures operating on the first level of abstraction are procedures \code{LocateChar} and \code{Width} that we discussed in the previous Section, as well as text formatters for a remote printer. In contrast, procedure \code{DisplayLine} operates on the second level.

The representation of characters as digital patterns is merely the last step in a complex font design and rendering process. At the beginning is a generic description of the shape of each character in the form of outlines and hints. Outlines are typically composed of straight lines and spline-curves. Hints are included to assist the digitizer in its effort to faithfully map the filled character outlines into the device raster. For example, hinting can guarantee consistency of serif shapes and stem widths across an entire font within a text, independent of the relative positions of the characters with respect to the grid lines. Automatic digitization produces digital patterns of sufficiently high quality for printing media resolutions. For screen resolutions, however, we prefer to add a hand-tuning step. This is the reason why digital patterns are not produced ``on the fly'' in Oberon.

Oberon's font management is encapsulated in module \code{Fonts}, with a low-level extension into the module \code{Display} that we already know from Chapter 4. The interface to module \code{Fonts} is very simple and narrow:
\begintt
MODULE Fonts;
  TYPE Font = POINTER TO FontDesc;
       FontDesc = RECORD
         name: ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;;
         height, minX, maxX, minY, maxY: INTEGER;
         next: Font
         END;
  VAR Default: Font;
  
  PROCEDURE GetPat(fnt: Font; ch: CHAR;
                   VAR dx, x, y, w, h, patadr: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE This (name: ARRAY OF CHAR): Font;
  PROCEDURE Free;
END Fonts.
\endtt
\noindent Variable \code{name} in type \code{Font} is the name of the underlying file. The variables \code{height}, \code{minX}, \code{maxX}, \code{minY}, and \code{maxY} designate line height and summary metric data. Default is a system-wide default font. It is installed at system loading time. \code{GetPat} delivers the geometric data for a given character in a given font (see Figure 5.5). This is a procedure to internalize (load) a font from a file given by its name. \code{Free} releases from storage fonts that are no longer needed.

Type \code{Font} should again be regarded as an abstract data type with two intrinsic operations \code{This} and \code{GetPat}. Thinking of the immutable nature of fonts, multiple internal copies of the same font are certainly undesirable. Therefore, internalized fonts are cached in a private list that manifests itself in a private field next in type \code{FontDesc}. The cache is maintained by the internalizing procedure \code{This} according to the following scheme:
\begintt
search font in cache;
IF found THEN return cached internalization
  ELSE internalize font; cache it
END
\endtt
\noindent The implementation of type Font did not raise many challenges. One, however, is an undesirable side-effect of caching. The problem arises if a font is used for a limited time only. Because it is referenced by the cache it will never be collected by the system's garbage collector. Two possible solutions offer themselves: a) provide an explicit freeing operation and b) enforce some special handling by the garbage collector based on a concept of ``weak'' pointers.

We conclude this Section with a formal specification of the font file format. Note that on the one hand, the file format is completely private to the managing Fonts module and on the other hand, it should be ultimately stable because it is probably used for long-term backup and for wide-range data exchange across multi-system platforms.

This is an \acro{EBNF} specification of the Oberon font file format:
\begintt
FontFile = ident header contents.
header = abstraction family variant height minX maxX minY maxY.
contents = nofRuns { beg end } { dx x y w h } { rasterByte }.
\endtt

\noindent \code{ident}, \code{abstraction}, \code{family}, and \code{variant} are one-byte values indicating file identification, abstraction (first level without raster bytes, second level with raster bytes), font family (Times Roman, Oberon, etc.), and variant (bold face, italics etc.). The values \code{height}, \code{minX}, \code{maxX}, \code{minY} and \code{maxY} are two bytes long each. They define in turn line height, minimum x-coordinate (of a box), maximum x-coordinate, minimum y-coordinate, and maximum y-coordinate. All values in production contents are two bytes long. \code{nofRuns} specifies the number of runs within the \acro{ASCII}-code range (intervals occupied without gaps) and every pair $[beg, end)$ describes one run. The tuples $(dx, x, y, w, h)$ are the metric data of the corresponding characters (in their \acro{ASCII}-code order), and the sequence of rasterByte gives the total of raster information.

In summary, fonts in Oberon are indexed libraries of objects. The objects are descriptions of character images in two levels of abstraction: As metric data of black boxes and as binary patterns (glyphs). Type \code{Font} is an abstract data type with intrinsic operations to internalize and to get character object data. Internalized fonts are cached in a private list.

\beginsubsection 5.5. THE EDIT TOOLBOX.

We have seen that every text frame integrates an interactive text editor that we can regard as an interpreter of a set of built-in commands (intrinsic commands). Of course, we would like to be able to extend this set by custom editing commands (extrinsic commands). Adding additional editing commands was indeed a worthwhile stress test for the underlying texts \acro{API}. Module \code{Edit} is the result of this effort. It is a toolbox of consisting of some standard extrinsic editing commands.
\begintt
DEFINITION Edit;
PROCEDURE Open; (*text viewer*)
PROCEDURE Show; (*text*)
PROCEDURE Locate; (*position*)
PROCEDURE Search; (*pattern*)
PROCEDURE Store; (*text*)
PROCEDURE Recall; (*deleted text*)
PROCEDURE CopyFont;
PROCEDURE ChangeFont;
PROCEDURE ChangeColor;
PROCEDURE ChangeOffset;
END Edit.
\endtt

\noindent The first group of commands in \code{Edit} is used to display, locate, and store texts or parts of texts. In turn they open a text file and display it, open a program text and show the declaration of a given object, locate a given position in a displayed text (main application: locating an error found by the compiler), search a pattern, and store the current state of a displayed text. Commands in the next group are related with editing. They allow restoring of the previously deleted part of text, copying a font attribute to the current text selection, and change attributes of the current text selection. Note that the commands \code{CopyFont}, \code{ChangeFont}, \code{ChangeColor}, and \code{ChangeOffset} are extrinsic variations of the intrinsic copy-look operation. The implementations of the toolbox commands are given in the Appendix.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 6: THE MODULE LOADER.

\beginsubsection 6.1. LINKING AND LOADING.

When the execution of a command \code{M.P} is requested, module \code{M} containing procedure \code{P} must be loaded, unless it is already loaded because a command from the same module had been executed earlier or if the module had been imported by another module before. Modules are available in the form of so-called \emph{object files}, generated by the compiler. The term \emph{loading} refers to the transfer of the module code from the file into main memory, from where the processor fetches individual instructions. This transfer involves also a certain amount of transformation as required by the object file format on the one hand and the storage layout on the other. A system typically consists of many modules, and hence loading modules also involves linking them together, in particular linking them with already loaded modules. Before loading, references to another module's objects are relative to the base address of this module; the linking or binding process converts them into absolute addresses.

The linking process may require a significant amount of address computations. But they are simple enough and, if the data are organized in an appropriate way, can be executed very swiftly. Nevertheless, and surprisingly, in many operating systems linking needs more time than compilation. The remedy which system designers offer is a separation of linking from loading. A set of compiled modules is first linked; the result is a linked object file with absolute addresses. The loader then merely transfers the object file into main store.

We consider this an unfortunate solution. Instead of trying to cure an inadequacy with the aid of an additional processing stage and an additional tool, it is wiser to cure the malady at its core, namely to speed up the linking process itself. Indeed, there is no separate linker in the Oberon system. The linker and loader are integrated and fast enough to avoid any desire for pre-linking. Furthermore, the extensibility of a system crucially depends on the possibility to link additional modules to the ones already loaded by calls from any module. This is called \emph{dynamic loading}. This is not possible with pre-linked object files. Newly loaded modules simply refer to the loaded ones, whereas pre-linked files lead to the presence of multiple copies of the same module code.

% TODO: It would be a good place to put an annotation with the current debate in the linux world about dynanmic libraries, updating for security fixes without recompiling, and versioning.

Evidently, the essence of linking is the conversion of relative addresses as generated by the compiler for all external references into absolute addresses as required during program execution. Before proceeding, we must consider an additional complication. Assume that a module \code{M1} is to be compiled which is a client of (that is, it imports) module \code{M0}. The interface of \code{M1}---in the form of a symbol file---does not specify the entry addresses of its exported procedures, but merely specifies a unique number (\code{pno}) for each one of them. The reason for this is that in this way the implementation of \code{M0} may be modified, causing a change of entry addresses, without affecting its interface specification. And this is a crucial property of the scheme of separate compilation of modules: changes of the implementation of \code{M0} must not necessitate the recompilation of clients (\code{M1}). The consequence is that the binding of entry addresses to procedure numbers must be performed by the linker. In order to make this possible, the object file must contain a list (table) of its entry addresses, one for each procedure number used as index to the table.

Similarly, the object file must contain a table of imported modules, containing their names. An external reference in the program code then appears in the form of a pair consisting of a module number (\code{mno}) - used as index to the import table (of modules) - and a procedure number (\code{pno}), used as index to the entry table of this module.

Certain linkage information must not only be provided in each object file, but also be present along with each loaded module's program code, because a module to be loaded must be linkable with modules loaded at any earlier time without reading their object files again.

\beginsubsection 6.2. MODULE REPRESENTATION.

The primary requirement is that a system must be represented in a form that allows to add new modules quickly. What is a sensible representation for this purpose? The simplest solution that comes to mind is a list of module blocks containing sections for the global data, for the program code, and perhaps meta data for the linking process. The list is rooted in a variable global to the loader module, here called \code{Modules}.

\figure{pdfs/fig-6.1.png}{3.7in}{6.1}{System of 4 modules}

The first part, containing the link to the next module, is called the module descriptor. On the Oberon System, it contains further links to the various sections of a module. The type \code{Module} is defined as follows:
\begintt
TYPE Module = POINTER TO ModDesc;
ModuleName = ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;
ModDesc = RECORD
  name: ModuleName;
  next: Module;
  key, num, size, refcnt: INTEGER;
  data, code, imp, cmd, ent, ptr: INTEGER (*addresses*)
END ;
\endtt

\noindent \code{key} is the module's key used for version consistency checking. The key changes if, and only if, the module's interface and thereby its symbol file changes. \code{num} is the module's number, which is the index of the module's entry in a global module table, referenced by the processor's \code{MT} register. The invariant relationship is
\begintt
ModTable[mod.mno] = mod.data
\endtt

\noindent for all \code{mod} in the module list. \code{size} is the entire module block's size excluding the descriptor, and \code{refcnt} is the number of other modules importing this module. This number is used to check whether a module can be released by procedure \code{Modules.Free}.

\figure{pdfs/fig-6.2.png}{2.1in}{6.2}{Module block headed by descriptor}

The section with meta data follows the data and code areas and consists of several parts. \emph{Imports} is an array of the modules imported by this module, each entry being the address of the respective module descriptor. \emph{Commands} is a sequence of procedure identifiers followed by their offset in the code section. This section is used when activating a command. \emph{Entries} is an array of offsets of all exported entities (including commands). This section is used by the loader itself for linking. \emph{Pointer refs} is an array of offsets of global pointer variables in the data section. These are used by the garbage collector as the roots of graphs of heap objects in use.

\beginsubsection 6.3. THE LINKING LOADER.

The purpose of the loader is to read object files, and to transform the file representation of modules into their internal image.

The loader is represented by procedure \code{Load} in module \code{Modules}. It accepts a name and returns a pointer to the specified module's descriptor. It first scans the list searching for the named module. Only if it is not present, the module is loaded and added to the list. Duplications therefore cannot occur.
\begintt
mod := root;
WHILE (mod # NIL) & (name # mod.name) DO mod := mod.next END ;
IF mod = NIL THEN (*load*) F := ThisFile(name); Files.Set(R, F, 0); ...
\endtt

\noindent First, the header of the respective object file is read. It specifies the required size of the block which is allocated in the module area at the position indicated by the global variable \code{AllocPtr}. Then the list of imports of the module being imported is read, and these module are imported. Evidently procedure \code{Load} is used recursively. Because cyclic imports are excluded, recursion always terminates.
\begintt
Files.ReadString(R, impname); (*imports*)
WHILE (impname[0] # 0X) & (res = 0) DO
  Files.ReadInt(R, impkey);
  Load(impname, impmod); import[nofimps] := impmod; importing := name1;
  IF res = 0 THEN
    IF impmod.key = impkey THEN INC(impmod.refcnt); INC(nofimps)
    ELSE error(3, name); imported := impname
    END
  END ;
  Files.ReadString(R, impname)
END
\endtt

\noindent 
The loading process stops, if a key mismatch is detected (\code{err} = 3). After successful loading of all imports, the loading of the actual module proceeds by allocating a descriptor and then reading the remaining sections of the file. The data is allocated (and cleared) and the code section is read in a straight-forward way without alteration.

At the very end of the file three integers called \code{fixorgP}, \code{fixorgD}, and \code{fixorgT} are read. They are the anchors of linked lists in the program code of instructions that need fixups. These fixups are performed only after the entire file had been read. Traversing the P-list, the pairs \code{mno}-\code{pno} are replaced by computed offsets in \code{BL} instructions (procedure calls). Traversing the D-list, addresses of \code{LDR} instructions and instruction pairs are fixed up, and traversing the T-list, addresses of type descriptors are computed and inserted. This low-level piece of code is shown below for call instructions (\code{BL}). Those for the D-List and the T-list are analogous.
\begintt
adr := mod.code + fixorgP*4;
WHILE adr # mod.code DO
  SYSTEM.GET(adr, inst);
  mno := inst DIV 100000H MOD 10H; (*decompose*)
  pno := inst DIV 1000H MOD 100H;
  disp := inst MOD 1000H;
  SYSTEM.GET(mod.imp + (mno-1)*4, impmod);
  SYSTEM.GET(impmod.ent + pno*4, dest); dest := dest + impmod.code;
  offset := (dest - adr - 4) DIV 4;
  SYSTEM.PUT(adr, (offset MOD 1000000H) + 0F7000000H); (*compose*)
  adr := adr - disp*4
END ;
\endtt

\noindent After the module has been loaded successfully, its initialisation body is executed.

Apart from \code{Load}, module \code{Modules} also contains the procedures
\begintt
PROCEDURE ThisCommand (mod: Module; name: ARRAY OF CHAR): Command;
PROCEDURE Free (name: ARRAY OF CHAR);
\endtt

\noindent The former yields the procedure named \code{name} from module \code{mod}. It is used in \code{TextFrames.Call} for activating command procedures. The latter unloads the named module, i.e. removes it from the list of loaded modules.

The frequent use of the low-level procedures \code{SYSTEM.GET} and \code{SYSTEM.PUT} is easily justified in base modules such as the loader or device drivers. After all, here data are transferred into untyped main storage.

\beginsubsection 6.4. THE TOOLBOX OF THE LOADER.

User commands directed to the loader are contained in module \code{System}. The toolbox offers the following three commands:
\smallskip
\item{} System.ShowModules
\item{} System.ShowCommands modname
\item{} System.Free {modname} ~
\smallskip
\noindent The first command opens a viewer and provides a list of all loaded modules. The list indicates the block length and the number of clients importing a module (the reference count). \code{ShowCommands} opens a viewer and lists the commands provided by the specified module. The commands are prefixed by the module name, and hence can immediately be activated by a mouse click. \code{Free} is called in order to remove modules either to regain storage space or to replace a module by a newly compiled version. A module can be dispensed only if (1) it has no clients, and (2) if does not declare any record types which are extensions of imported types.

\beginsubsection 6.5. THE OBERON OBJECT FILE FORMAT.

The name extension of object files is \code{.rsc}. Their syntax is the following:
\begintt
CodeFile = name key version size
imports typedesc varsize strings code commands entries ptrrefs fixP fixD fixT body "O".
imports = {modname key} 0X.
typedesc = nof {byte}.
strings = nof {char}.
code = nof {word}.
commands = {comname offset} 0X.
entries = nof {word}.
ptrrefs = {word} 0.
\endtt

\noindent \code{fixP}, \code{fixD}, \code{fixT} are the origins of chains of instructions to be updated (fixed up). \code{body} is the entry point offset of the module body.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 7: THE FILE SYSTEM.

\beginsubsection 7.1. FILES.

It is essential that a computer system has a facility for storing data over longer periods of time and for retrieving the stored data. Such a facility is called a \emph{file system}. Evidently, a file system cannot accommodate all possible data types and structures that will be programmed in the future. Hence, it is necessary to provide a simple, yet flexible enough base structure that allows any data structure to be mapped onto this base structure (and vice-versa) in a reasonably straight-forward and efficient way. This base structure, called \emph{file}, is a sequence of bytes. As a consequence, any given structure to be transformed into a file must be sequentialized. The notion of sequence is indeed fundamental, and it requires no further explanation and theory. We recall that texts are sequences of characters, and that characters are typically represented as bytes.

The sequence is also the natural abstraction of all physically moving storage media. Among them are magnetic tapes and disks. Magnetic media have the welcome property of non-volatility and are therefore the primary choices for storing data over longer periods of time, especially over periods where the equipment is switched off. Sequential access is also necessary for media that allow access only by large blocks, such as flash-RAMs and SD-cards.

A further advantage of the sequence is that its transmission between media is simple too. The reason is that its structural information is inherent and need not be encoded and transmitted in addition to the actual data. This implicitness of structural information is particularly convenient in the case of moving storage media, because they impose strict timing constraints on transmission of consecutive elements. Therefore, the process which generates (or consumes) the data must be effectively decoupled from the transmission process that observes the timing constraints. In the case of sequences, this decoupling is simple to achieve by dividing a sequence into subsequences which are buffered. A sequence is output to the storage medium by alternately generating data (and filling the buffer holding the current subsequence) and transmitting data (fetching elements from the buffer and transmitting them). The size of the subsequences (and the buffer) depends on the storage medium under consideration: there must be no timing constraints between accesses to consecutive subsequences.

The file is not a static data structure like the array or the record, because the length may increase dynamically, i.e. during program execution. On the other hand, the sequence is less flexible than general dynamic structures, because it cannot change its form, but only its length, since elements can only be appended but not inserted. It might therefore be called a semi-dynamic structure.

The discipline of purely sequential access to a file is enforced by restricting access to calls of specific procedures, typically read and write procedures for scanning and generating a file. In the jargon of data processing, a file must be opened before reading or writing is possible. The opening implies the initialization of a reading and writing mechanism, and in particular the fixing of its initial position. Hence each (opened) file not only has a value and a length, but also a position attributed to it. If reading must occur from several positions (still sequentially) alternately, the file is ``multiply opened''; it implies that the same file is represented by several variables, each denoting a different position.

This widespread view of files is conceptually unappealing, and the Oberon file system therefore departs from it by introducing the notion of a rider. A file simply has a value, the sequence of bytes, and a length, the number of bytes in the sequence. Reading and writing occurs through a rider, which denotes a position. ``Multiple opening'' is achieved by simply using several riders riding on the same file. Thereby the two concepts of data structure (\emph{file}) and access mechanism (\emph{rider}) are clearly distinct and properly disentangled.

Given a file \code{f}, a rider \code{r} is placed on a file by the call
\code{Files.Set (r, f, pos)}, where \code{pos} indicates the position from which reading or writing is to start. Calls of \code{Files.Read (r, x)} and \code{Files.Write (r, x)} implicitly increment the position beyond the element read or written, and the file is implicitly denoted via the explicit parameter \code{r}, which denotes a rider. The rider has two (visible) attributes, namely \code{r.eof} and \code{r.res}. The former is set to \code{FALSE} by \code{Files.Set}, and to \code{TRUE} when a read operation could not be performed, because the end of the file had been reached. \code{r.res} serves as a result variable in procedures \code{ReadBytes} and \code{WriteBytes} allowing one to check for correct termination.

A file system must not only provide the concept of a sequence with its accessing mechanism, but also a registry. This implies that files be identified, that they can be given a name by which they are registered and retrieved. The registry or collection of registered names is called the file system's directory. Here we wish to emphasize that the concepts of files as data structure with associated access facilities on the one hand, and the concept of file naming and directory management on the other hand must also be considered separately and as independent notions. In fact, in the Oberon system their implementation underscores this separation by the existence of two modules: \code{Files} and \code{FileDir}. The following procedures are available. They are summarized by the interface specification (definition) of module \code{Files}.
\begintt
DEFINITION Files;
  TYPE File = POINTER TO FileDesc;
     FileDesc = RECORD END ;
     Rider = RECORD eof: BOOLEAN; res: INTEGER END ;

  PROCEDURE Old(name: ARRAY OF CHAR): File;
  PROCEDURE New(name: ARRAY OF CHAR): File;
  PROCEDURE Register(f: File);
  PROCEDURE Close(f: File);
  PROCEDURE Purge(f: File);
  PROCEDURE Length(f: File): INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE Date(f: File): INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Set(VAR r: Rider; f: File; pos: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE ReadByte(VAR r: Rider; VAR x: BYTE);
  PROCEDURE ReadBytes(VAR r: Rider; VAR x: ARRAY OF BYTE; n: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Read(VAR r: Rider; VAR ch: CHAR);
  PROCEDURE ReadInt(VAR r: Rider; VAR n: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE ReadSet(VAR r: Rider; VAR s: SET);
  PROCEDURE ReadReal(VAR r: Rider; VAR x: REAL);
  PROCEDURE ReadString(VAR r: Rider; VAR s: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  PROCEDURE ReadNum(VAR r: Rider; VAR n: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE WriteByte(VAR r: Rider; x: BYTE);
  PROCEDURE WriteBytes(VAR r: Rider; x: ARRAY OF BYTE; n: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE WriteInt(VAR r: Rider; n: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE WriteSet(VAR r: Rider; s: SET);
  PROCEDURE WriteReal(VAR r: Rider; x: REAL);
  PROCEDURE WriteString(VAR r: Rider; x: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  PROCEDURE WriteNum(VAR r: Rider; n: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Pos(VAR r: Rider): INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE Base(VAR r: Rider): File;
  PROCEDURE Rename(old, new: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Delete(name: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR res: INTEGER);
END Files.
\endtt

\noindent \code{New(name)} yields a new (empty) file without registering it in the directory. \code{Old(name)} retrieves the file with the specified name, or yields \code{NIL}, if it is not found in the directory. \code{Register(f)} inserts the name of \code{f} (specified in the call of \code{New}) in the directory. An already existing entry with this name is replaced. \code{Close(f)} must be called after writing is completed and the file is not to be registered. \code{Close} actually stands for ``close buffers'', and is implied in the procedure \code{Register}. Procedure \code{Purge} will be explained at the end of section 7.2.

The sequential scan of a file \code{f} (reading characters) is programmed as shown in the following template:
\begintt
VAR f: Files.File;
    r: Files.Rider;
f := Files.Old(name);
IF f # NIL THEN
  Files.Set (r, f, 0);
  Files.Read (r, x);
  WHILE ~ r.eof DO
    ... x ...;
    Files.Read(r, x)
  END
END
\endtt

\noindent The analogous template for a purely sequential writing is:
\begintt
f := Files.New(name);
Files.Set(r, f, 0);
WHILE ... DO Files.Write (r, x); ... END
Files.Register(f)
\endtt

There exist two further procedures; they do not change any files, but only affect the directory. \code{Delete(name, res)} causes the removal of the named entry from the directory. \code{Rename(old, new, res)} causes the replacement of the directory entry old by new.

It may surprise the reader that these two procedures, which affect the directory only, are exported from module \code{Files} instead of \code{FileDir}. The reason is that the presence of the two modules, together forming the file system, is also used for separating the interface into a public and a private (or semi-public) part. The definition (in the form of a symbol file) of \code{FileDir} is not intended to be freely available, but restricted to use by system programmers. This allows the export of certain sensitive data, (such as file headers) and sensitive procedures (such as \code{Enumerate}) without the danger of misuse by inadvertent users.

Module \code{Files} constitutes a most important interface whose stability is utterly essential, because it is used by almost every module programmed. During the entire time span of development of the Oberon system, this interface had changed only once. We also note that this interface is very terse, a factor contributing to its stability. Yet, the offered facilities have in practice over years proved to be both necessary and sufficient.

\beginsubsection 7.2. IMPLEMENTATION OF FILES ON A RANDOM-ACCESS STORE.

A file cannot be allocated as a block of contiguous storage locations, because its length is not fixed. Neither can it be represented as a linked list of individual elements, because this would lead to inefficient use of storage---more might be used for the links than the elements themselves. The solution generally adopted is a compromise between the two extremes: files are represented as lists of blocks (subsequently called sectors) of fixed length. A block is appended when the last one is filled. On the average, each file therefore wastes half of a sector. Typical sector sizes are 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 Kbytes, depending on the device used as store.

It immediately follows that access to an element is not as simple as in the case of an array. The primary concern in the design of a file system and access scheme must be the efficiency of access to individual elements while scanning the sequence, at least in the case when the next element lies within the same sector. This access must be no more complicated than a comparison of two variables followed by an indexed access to the file element and the incrementing of an address pointing to the element's successor. If the successor lies in another sector, the procedure may be more involved, as transitions to the next sector occur much less frequently.

The second most crucial design decision concerns the data structure in which sectors are organized; it determines how a succeeding sector is located. The simplest solution is to link sectors in a list. This is acceptable if access is to be restricted to purely sequential scans. Although this would be sufficient for most applications, it is unnecessarily restrictive for media other than purely sequential ones (tapes). After all, it is sometimes practical to position a rider at an arbitrary point in the file rather than always at its beginning. This is made possible by the use of an indexed sector table, typically stored as a header in the file. The table is an array of the addresses of the file's data sectors. Unfortunately, the length of the table needed is unknown. Choosing a fixed length for all files is controversial, because it inevitably leads to either a limitation of file length (when chosen too small) that is unacceptable in some applications, or to a large waste of file space (when chosen too large). Experience shows that in practice most files are quite short, i.e. in the order of a few thousand bytes. The dilemma is avoided by a two-level table, i.e. by using a table of tables.

The scheme chosen in Oberon is slightly more complex in order to favor short files ($<$ 64 K bytes): Each file header contains a table of 64 entries, each pointing to a 1K byte sector. Additionally, it contains a table of 12 entries, the so-called extensions, each pointing to an index sector containing 256 further sector pointers. The file length is thereby limited to $64 + 12 \times 256$ sectors, or 3,211,264 bytes (minus the length of the header). The chosen structure is illustrated in Fig. 7.1. sec[0] always points to the sector containing the file header.

\figure{pdfs/fig-7.1.png}{3.5in}{7.1}{File header and extension sectors}

The header contains some additional data, namely the length of the file (in bytes), its name, and date and time of its creation. The size of the header is 352 bytes; the remaining 672 bytes of the first sector are used for data. Hence, truly short files occupy a single sector only. The declaration of the file header is contained in the definition of module \code{FileDir}. An abbreviated version containing the fields relevant so far is:
\begintt
FileHeader = RECORD leng: INTEGER;
ext: ARRAY 12 OF SectorPointer;
sec: ARRAY 64 OF SectorPointer END
\endtt

\noindent We now turn our attention to the implementation of file access, and first present a system that uses main storage for the file data instead of a disk and therefore avoids the problems introduced by sector buffering. The key data structure in this connection is the \code{Rider}, represented as a record.
\begintt
Rider = RECORD
eof: BOOLEAN; res, pos, adr: INTEGER; file: File
END
\endtt

\noindent A rider is initialised by a call \code{Set(r, f, pos)}, which places the rider \code{r} on file \code{f} at position \code{pos}. From this it is clear that the rider record must contain fields denoting the attached file and the rider's position on it. We note that they are not exported. However, their values can be obtained by the function procedures \code{Pos(r)} and \code{Base(r)}. This allows a (hidden) representation most appropriate for an efficient implementation of \code{Read} and \code{Write} without being unsafe.

Consider now the call \code{Read(r, x)}; its task is to assign the value of the byte designated by the rider's position to \code{x} and to advance the position to the next byte. Considering the structure by which file data are represented, we easily obtain the following program, assuming that the position is legal, i.e. non-negative and less than the file's length. \code{a}, \code{b}, \code{c} are local variables, \code{HS} is the size of the header (in sector 0), \code{SS} is the sector size, typically a power of 2 in order to make division efficient.
\begintt
a:=(r.pos+HS)DIVSS; b:=(r.pos+HS)MODSS;
IF a < 64 THEN c := r.file.sec[a]
ELSE c := r.file.ext[(a - 64) DIV 256].sec[(a - 64) MOD 256] END ;
SYSTEM.GET(c + b, x) ; INC (r.pos)
\endtt

\noindent In order to gain efficiency, we use the low-level procedure \code{GET} that assigns the value at address \code{c+b} to \code{x}. This program is reasonably short, but involves considerable address computations at every access, and in particular at positions larger than \code{64 * SS}. Fortunately, there exists an easy remedy, namely that of caching the address of the current position. This explains the presence of the field \code{adr} in the rider record. The resulting program is shown below; note that in order to avoid the addition of \code{HS}, \code{pos} is defined to denote the genuine position, i.e. the abstract position augmented by \code{HS}.
\begintt
SYSTEM.GET(r.adr, x); INC(r.adr); INC(r.pos); IF r.pos MOD SS = 0 THEN
m := r.pos DIV SS;
IF m < 64 THEN r.adr := r.file.sec[m]
ELSE r.adr := r.file.ext[(m - 64) DIV 256].sec[(m - 64) MOD 256] END
END
\endtt

\noindent We emphasize that in all but one out of 1024 cases only three instructions and a single test are to be executed. This improvement therefore is crucial to the efficiency of file access, and to that of the entire Oberon System. We now present the entire file module (for files on a random-access store).

\noindent Allocation of a new sector occurs upon creating a file (\code{Files.New}), and when writing at the end of a file after the current sector had been filled. Procedure \code{AllocSector} yields the address of the allocated sector. It is determined by a search in the sector reservation table for a free sector. In this table, every sector is represented by a single bit indicating whether or not the sector is allocated. Although conceptually belonging to the file system, this table resides within module \code{Kernel}.

Deallocation of a file's sectors could occur as soon as the file is no longer accessible, neither through a variable of any loaded module nor from the file directory. However, this moment is difficult to determine. Therefore, the method of garbage collection is used in Oberon for the deallocation of file space. In consideration of the fact that file space is large and the collection of unused sectors relatively time-consuming, we confine this process to system initialization. It is represented by procedure \code{FileDir.Init}. At that time, the only referenced files are those registered in the directory. \code{Init} therefore scans the entire directory and records the sectors referenced in each file in the sector reservation table (see Sect. 7.4).

For applications where system startup and initialization is supposed to occur very infrequently, such as for server systems, a procedure \code{Files.Purge} is provided. Its effect is to return the sectors used by the specified file to the pool of free sectors. Evidently, the programmer then bears the responsibility to guarantee that no references to the purged file continue to exist. This may be possible in a closed server system, but files should not be purged under normal circumstances, as a violation of said precondition will lead to unpredictable disaster.

The following procedures used for allocating, deallocating, and marking sectors in the sector reservation table are defined in module \code{Kernel}:
\begintt
PROCEDURE AllocSector(hint: INTEGER; VAR sec: INTEGER); (*used in WriteByte*)
PROCEDURE MarkSector(sec: INTEGER); (*used in Init*)
PROCEDURE FreeSector(sec: INTEGER); (*used in Purge*)

\beginsubsection 7.3. IMPLEMENTATION OF FILES ON A DISK.

First we recall that the organization of files as sets of individually allocated blocks (sectors) is inherently required by the allocation considerations of dynamically growing sequences. However, if the storage medium is a tape, a disk, or a flash-\acro{RAM}, there exists an additional reason for the use of blocks. They constitute the subsequences to be individually buffered for transmission in order to overcome the timing constraints imposed by the medium. If an adequate space utilization is to be achieved, the blocks must not be too long. A typical size is 1, 2, or 4K bytes.

This necessity of buffering has a profound influence on the implementation of file access. The complication arises because the abstraction of the sequence of individual bytes needs to be maintained. The increase in complexity of file access is considerable, as can be seen by comparing the program listings of the two respective implementations.

The first, obvious measure is to copy the file's sector table into primary store when a file is ``opened'' through a call of \code{New()} or \code{Old()}. The record holding this copy is the file descriptor, and the value \code{f} denoting the file points to this handle (instead of the actual header on disk). The descriptor also contains the remaining information stored in the header, in particular the file's length.

If a file is read (or written) in purely sequential manner, a single buffer is appropriate for the transfer of data. For reading, the buffer is filled by reading a sector from the disk, and bytes are picked up individually from the buffer. For writing, bytes are deposited individually, and the buffer is written onto disk as a whole when full. The buffer is associated with the file, and a pointer to it is contained in the descriptor.

However, we recall that several riders may be placed on a file and be moved independently. It might be appealing to associate a buffer with each rider. But this proposal must quickly be rejected when we realize that several riders may be active at neighbouring positions. If these positions refer to the same sector, which is duplicated in the riders' distinct buffers, the buffers may easily become inconsistent. Obviously, buffers must not be associated with riders, but with the file itself. The descriptor therefore contains the head of a list of linked buffers. Each buffer is identified by its position in the file. An invariant of the system is that no two buffers represent the same sector.

Even with the presence of a single rider, the possibility of having several buffers associated with a file can be advantageous, if a rider is frequently repositioned. It becomes a question of strategy and heuristics when to allocate a new buffer. In the Oberon system, we have adopted the following solution:
\smallskip
\item{1.} The first buffer is created when the file is opened (New, Old).
\item{2.} Additional buffers may be allocated when a rider is placed (or repositioned) on the file.
\item{3.} At most four buffers are connected to the same file.
\item{4.} Purely sequential movements of riders do not cause allocation of buffers.
\item{5.} Separate buffers are generated when extensions of the file's sector table need be accessed (rider position $>$ 64K). Each buffers the 256 sector addresses of the respective index sector.
\smallskip
\noindent The outlined scheme requires and is based upon the following data structures and types:
\begintt
File = POINTER TO FileDesc;
Buffer = POINTER TO BufferRecord;
Index = POINTER TO IndexRecord;

FileDesc = RECORD next: File;
             aleng, bleng: INTEGER; (*file length*)
             nofbufs: INTEGER; (*no. of buffers allocated*)
             modH, registered: BOOLEAN; (*header has been modified*)
             firstbuf: Buffer: (*head of buffer chain*)
             sechint: DiskAdr; (*sector hint*)
             name: FileDir.FileName;
             date: INTEGER;
             ext: ARRAY FileDir.ExTabSize OF Index;
             sec: ARRAY 64 OF DiskAdr
           END;
           
BufferRecord = RECORD apos, lim: INTEGER;(*lim = no. of bytes*)
                 mod: BOOLEAN; (*buffer has been modified*)
                 next: Buffer; (*buffer chain*)
                 data: FileDir.DataSector
               END;

IndexRecord = RECORD adr: DiskAdr;
                mod: BOOLEAN; (*index record has been modified*)
                sec: FileDir.IndexSector END;
                
Rider =  RECORD eof: BOOLEAN; (*end of file reached*)
           res: INTEGER; (*no. of unread bytes*)
           file: File;
           apos, bpos: INTEGER; (*position*)
           buf: Buffer (*hint: likely buffer*)
         END;
\endtt

\noindent In order to increase efficiency of access, riders have been provided with a field containing the address of the element of the rider's position. From the conditions stated above for the allocation of buffers, it is evident that the value of this field can be a hint only. This implies that there can be no reliance on its information. Whenever it is used, its validity has to be checked. The check consists in a comparison of the riders' position \code{r.apos} with the hinted buffer's actual position \code{r.buf.apos}. If they differ, a buffer with the desired position must be searched and, if not present, allocated. The advantage of the hint lies in the fact that the hint is correct with a very high probability. The check is included in procedures \code{Read}, \code{ReadByte}, \code{Write}, and \code{WriteByte}.

Some fields of the record types require additional explanations:

\noindent 1. The length is stored in a ``preprocessed'' form, namely by the two integers \code{aleng} and \code{bleng} such that aleng is a sector number and
\begintt
length = (aleng * SS) + bleng - HS
aleng = (length + HS) DIV SS
bleng = (length + HS) MOD SS
\endtt
The same holds for the form of the position in riders (\code{apos}, \code{bpos}).

\smallskip\noindent 2. The field \code{nofbufs} indicates the number of buffers in the list headed by \code{firstbuf}:
$$1 \le {\tt nofbufs} \le {\tt Maxbufs}$$
3. Whenever data are written into a buffer, the file becomes inconsistent, i.e. the data on the disk are outdated. The file is updated, i.e. the buffer is copied into the corresponding disk sector, whenever the buffer is reallocated, e.g. during sequential writing after the buffer is full and is ``advanced''. During sequential reading, a buffer is also advanced and reused, but needs not be copied onto disk, because it is still consistent. Whether a buffer is consistent or not is indicated by its state variable \code{mod} (modified). Similarly, the field \code{modH} in the file descriptor indicates whether or not the header had been modified.

\smallskip\noindent 4. The field \code{sechint} records the number of the last sector allocated to the file and serves as a hint to the kernel's allocation procedure, which allocates a next sector with an address larger than the hint. This is a measure to gain speed in sequential scans.

\smallskip\noindent 5. The buffer's position is specified by its field \code{apos}. Used as index in the file header's sector table, it yields the sector corresponding to the current buffer contents. The field \code{lim} specifies the number of bytes's stored in the buffer. Reading cannot proceed beyond this limiting index; writing beyond it implies an increase in the file's length. All buffers except the one for the last sector are filled and specify \code{lim = SS}.

\smallskip\noindent 6. The hidden rider field buf is merely a hint to speed up localization of the concerned buffer. A hint is likely, but not guaranteed to be correct. Its validity must be checked before use. The buffer hint is invalidated when a buffer is reallocated and/or a rider is repositioned.

The structure of riders remains practically the same as for files using main store. The hidden field \code{adr} is merely replaced by a pointer to the buffer covering the rider's position. A configuration of a file \code{f} with two riders is shown in Fig 7.2.

Some comments concerning module \code{Files} follow.

\smallskip\noindent 1. After the writing of a file has been completed, its name is usually registered in the directory. \code{Register} invokes procedure \code{Unbuffer}. It inspects the associated buffers and copies those onto disk which had been modified. During this process, new index sectors may have to be transferred as well. If a file is to remain anonymous and local to a module or command, i.e. is not to be registered, but merely to be read, the release of buffers must be specified by an explicit call to \code{Close} (meaning ``close buffers''), which also invokes \code{Unbuffer}.

\figure{pdfs/fig-7.2.png}{3.5in}{7.2}{File \code{f} with two riders and two buffers}

\smallskip\noindent 2. Procedure \code{Old} (and for reasons of consistency also \code{New}) deviates from the general Oberon programming rule that an object be allocated by the calling (instead of the called) module. This rule would suggest the statements
\begintt
New(f); Files.Open(f, name)
\endtt

\noindent instead of \code{f := Files.Old(name)}. The justification for the rule is that any extension of the type of \code{f} could be allocated, providing for more flexibility. And the reason for our deviation in the case of files is that, upon closer inspection, not a new file, but only a new descriptor is to be allocated. The distinction becomes evident when we consider that several statements \code{f := Files.Old(name)} with different \code{f} and identical name may occur, probably in different modules. In this case, it is necessary that the same descriptor is referenced by the delivered pointers in order to avoid file inconsistency. Each (opened) file must have exactly one descriptor. When a file is opened, the first action is therefore to inspect whether a descriptor of this file already exists. For this purpose, all descriptors are linked together in a list anchored by the global variable \code{root} and linked by the descriptor field \code{next}. This measure may seem to solve the problem of avoiding inconsistencies smoothly. However, there exists a pitfall that is easily overlooked: All opened files would permanently remain accessible via \code{root}, and the garbage collector could never remove a file descriptor nor its associated buffers. This would be unacceptable. In order to hide this list from the garbage collector, it is represented by integers (addresses) instead of pointers.

3. Sector pointers are represented by sector numbers of type \code{INTEGER}. Actually, we use the numbers multiplied by 29. This implies that any single-bit error leads to a number which is not a multiple of 29, and hence can easily be detected. Thereby the crucial sector addresses are software parity checked and are safe (against single-bit errors) even on computers without hardware parity check. The check is performed by procedures \code{Kernel.GetSector} and \code{Kernel.PutSector}.

\beginsubsection 7.4. THE FILE DIRECTORY.

A directory is a set of pairs, each pair consisting of a name (key) and an object (here: file). It serves to retrieve objects by their name. If efficiency matters, the directory is organized as an ordered set, ordered according to the keys. The most frequently used structures for ordered sets are trees and hash tables. The latter have disadvantages when the size of the set is unknown, particularly when its order of magnitude is unknown, and when deletions occur. The Oberon system therefore uses a tree structure for its file directory, more specifically a B-tree, which was developed especially for cases where not individual pairs, but only sets of pairs as a whole (placed on a disk sector) can be accessed.

For a thorough study of B-trees we refer the reader to the literature\footnote{{\mc[1]}}{R. Bayer and E. M. McCreight. Organization and maintenance of large ordered indexes. Acta Informatica, 1, 3, (1972), 173-189.}\footnote{{\mc[2]}}{D. Comer. The ubiquitous B-tree. ACM Comp Surveys, 11, 2, (June 1979), 121-137.}. Here it must suffice to specify the B-tree's principal characteristics:

\item{1.} In a B-tree of order $N$, each node (called page) contains $m$ elements (pairs), where $N \le m \le 2N$, except the root, where $0 \le m \le 2N$.
\item{2.} A page with $m$ elements has either 0 descendants, in which case it is called a leaf page, or $m + 1$ descendants.
\item{3.} All leaf pages are on the same (bottom) level.

From 3. it follows that the B-tree is a balanced tree. Its height, and with it the longest path's length, has an upper bound of, roughly, $2 \times \log{k}$, where $k$ is the number of elements and the logarithm is taken to the base $N$ and rounded up to the next larger integer. Its minimal height is $\log{k}$ taken to the base $2N$.

On each page, space must be available for $2N$ elements and for $2N + 1$ references to descendants. Hence, $N$ is immediately determined by the size of a page and the size of elements. In the case of the Oberon system, names are limited to 32 characters (bytes), and the object is a reference to the associated file (4 bytes). Each descendant pointer takes 4 bytes, and the page size is given by the sector size (1024) minus the number of bytes needed to store $m$ (2 bytes). Hence
$$N = ((1024 - 2 - 4) \div (32 + 4 + 4)) \div 2 = 12$$
\eject
A B-tree of height $h$ and order 12 may contain the following minimal and maximal number of elements:

\medskip\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
height&minimum&maximum\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
1& 0& 24\cr
2& 25& 624\cr
3& 625& 15624\cr
4& 15625& 390624\cr
}\medskip

It follows that the height of the B-tree will never be larger than 4, if the disk has a capacity of less than about 400 Mbyte, and assuming that each file occupies a single 1K sector. It is rarely larger than 3 in practice.

The definition of module \code{FileDir} shows the available directory operations. Apart from the procedures \code{Search}, \code{Insert}, \code{Delete}, and \code{Enumerate}, it contains some data definitions, and it should be considered as the non-public part of the file system's interface.

  PROCEDURE Insert(name: FileName; fad: DiskAdr);
  PROCEDURE Delete(name: FileName; VAR fad: DiskAdr);
  PROCEDURE Enumerate(prefix: ARRAY OF CHAR; proc: EntryHandler);
END FileDir.
\endtt

\noindent Procedures \code{Search}, \code{Insert}, and \code{Delete} represent the typical operations performed on a directory. Efficiency of the first operation is of primary importance. But the B-tree structure also guarantees efficient insertion and deletion, although the code for these operations is complex. Procedure \code{Enumerate} is used to obtain excerpts of the directory. The programmer must guarantee that no directory changes are performed by the parametric procedure of \code{Enumerate}.

As in the presentation of module \code{Files}, we first discuss a version that uses main storage rather than a disk for the directory. This allows us to concentrate on the algorithms for handling the directory, leaving out the additional complications due to the necessity to read pages (sectors) into main store for selective updating and of restoring them onto disk. In particular, we point out the definitions of the data types for B-tree nodes, called \code{DirPage}, and elements, called \code{DirEntry}. The component \code{E.p} of an entry \code{E} points to the page in which all elements (with index \code{k}) have keys \code{E.p.e[k].name} $>$ \code{E.name}. The pointer \code{p.p0} points to a page in which all elements have keys \code{p.p0.e[k].name} $<$ \code{p.e[0].name}. We can visualize these conditions by Fig. 7.3, where names have been replaced by integers as keys.

\figure{pdfs/fig-7.3.png}{3.9in}{7.3}{Example of a B-tree of order 2}

Procedure \code{Search} starts by inspecting the root page. It performs a binary search among its elements, according to the following algorithm. Let $e[0 ... m-1]$ be the ordered keys and $x$ the search argument.
\begintt
L := 0; R := m;
WHILE L < R DO
  i := (L+R) DIV 2;
  IF x <= e[i] THEN R := i ELSE L := i + 1 END
END;
IF (R < m) & (x = e[R]) THEN found END
\endtt

\noindent The invariant is
$$e[L-1] < x \le e[R]$$
If the desired element is not found, the search continues on the appropriate descendant page, if there is one. Otherwise the element is not contained in the tree.

Procedures \code{insert} and \code{delete} use the same algorithm for searching an element within a page. However, they use recursion instead of iteration to proceed along the search path of pages. We recall that the depth of recursion is at most four. The reason for the use of recursion is that it facilitates the formulation of structural changes, which are performed during the ``unwinding'' of recursion, i.e. on the return path. First, the insertion point (respectively the position of the element to be deleted) is searched, and then the element is inserted (deleted).

Upon insertion, the number of elements on the insertion page may become larger than $2N$, violating B-tree condition 1. This situation is called \emph{page overflow}. The invariant must be reestablished immediately. It could be achieved by moving one element from either end of the array e onto a neighbouring page. However, we choose not to do this, and instead to split the overflowing page into two pages immediately. The process of a \emph{page split} is visualized by Fig 7.4, in which we distinguish between three cases, namely $R < N$, $R = N$, and $R > N$, where $R$ marks the insertion point. \code{a} denotes the overflowing, \code{b} the new page, and \code{u} the inserted element.

The $2N + 1$ elements ($2N$ from the full page \code{a}, plus the one element u to be inserted) are equally distributed onto pages \code{a} and \code{b}. One element \code{v} is pushed up in the tree. It must be inserted in the ancestor page of \code{a}. Since that page obtains an additional descendant, it must also obtain an additional element in order to maintain B-tree rule 2.

A page split may thus propagate, because the insertion of element \code{v} in the ancestor page may require a split once again. If the root page is full, it is split too, and the emerging element \code{v} is inserted in a new root page containing a single element. This is the only way in which the height of a B-tree can increase.

\figure{pdfs/fig-7.4.png}{3.9in}{7.4}{Page split when inserting element \code{u}}

When an element is to be deleted, it cannot simply be removed, if it resides on an internal page. In this case, it is first replaced by another element, namely one of the two neighbouring elements on a leaf page, i.e. the next smaller (or next larger) element, which is always on a leaf page. In the presented solution, the replacing element is the largest on the left subtree (see procedure \code{del}). Hence, the actual deletion always occurs on a leaf page.

Upon deletion, the number of elements in a page may become less than $N$, violating invariant 1. This event is called page underflow. Since restructuring the tree is a relatively complicated operation, we first try to reestablish the invariant by borrowing an element from a neighbouring page. In fact, it is reasonable to borrow several elements, and thereby to decrease the likelihood of an underflow on the same page upon further deletions. The number of elements that could be taken from the neighbouring page \code{b} is \code{b.m - N}. Hence we will borrow

$$k = (b.m - N + 1) \div 2$$

elements. The process of page balancing then distributes the elements of the underflowing and its neighbouring page equally to both pages (see procedure \code{underflow}).

However, if (and only if) the neighbouring page has no elements to spare, the two pages can and must be united. This action, called page merge, places the $N-1$ elements from the underflowing page, the $N$ elements from the neighbouring page, plus one element from the ancestor page onto a single page of size $2N$. One element must be taken from the ancestor page, because that page loses one descendant and invariant rule 2 must be maintained. The events of page balancing and merging are illustrated in Fig 7.5. \code{a} is the underflowing page, \code{b} its neighbouring page, and \code{c} their ancestor; \code{s} is the position in the ancestor page of (the pointer to the) underflowing page \code{a}. Two cases are distinguished, namely whether the underflowing page is the rightmost element (\code{s = c.m}) or not (see procedure \code{underflow}).

\figure{pdfs/fig-7.5.png}{3.9in}{7.5}{Page balancing and merging when deleting element}

Similarly to the splitting process, merging may propagate, because the removal of an element from the ancestor page may again cause an underflow, and perhaps a merge. The root page underflows only if its last element is removed. This is the only way in which the B-tree's height can decrease.

\endtt

\noindent The B-tree is also a highly appropriate structure for enumerating its elements, because during the traversal of the tree each page is visited exactly once, and hence needs to be read (from disk) exactly once too. The traversal is programmed by the procedure \code{Enumerate} and uses recursion. It calls the parametric procedure \code{proc} for each element of the tree. The type of \code{proc} specifies as parameters the name and the (address of) the enumerated element. The third parameter continue is a \code{Boolean} \code{VAR}-parameter. If the procedure sets it to \code{FALSE}, the process of enumeration will be aborted.

\code{Enumerate} is used for obtaining listings of the names of registered files. For this purpose, the actual procedure substituted for \code{proc} merely enters the given name in a text and ignores the address (sector number) of the file, unless it requires special file information such as the file's size or creation date.

The set of visited elements can be restricted by specifying a string which is to be a prefix to all enumerated names. The least name with the specified prefix is directly searched and is the name (\code{key}) of the first element enumerated. The process then proceeds up to the first element whose name does not have the given prefix. Thereby, the process of obtaining all elements whose key has a given prefix avoids traversal of the whole tree, resulting in a significant speedup. If the prefix is the empty string, the entire tree is traversed.

The principle behind procedure \code{Enumerate} is shown by the following sketch, where we abstract from the B-tree structure and omit consideration of prefixes:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Enumerate(
            proc: PROCEDURE (name: FileName; adr: INTEGER;
                             VAR continue: BOOLEAN));
  VAR continue: BOOLEAN; this: DirEntry;
BEGIN continue := TRUE; this := FirstElement;
  WHILE continue & (this # NIL) DO
    proc(this.name, this.adr, continue); this := NextEntry(this)
  END
END Enumerate
\endtt

\noindent From this sketch we may conclude that during the process of traversal the tree structure must not change, because the function \code{NextEntry} quite evidently relies on the structural information stored in the elements of structure itself. Hence, the actions of the parametric procedure must not affect the tree structure. Enumeration must not be used, for example, to delete a given set of files. In order to prevent the misuse of the indispensible facility of element enumeration, the interface of \code{FileDir} is not available to users in general.

The handling of the directory stored on disk follows exactly the same algorithms. The accessed pages are fetched from the disk as a whole (each page fits onto a single disk sector) and stored in buffers of type \code{DirPage}, from where individual elements can be accessed. In principle, these buffers can be local to procedures insert and delete. A single buffer is allocated globally, namely the one used by procedure \code{Search}. The reason for this exception is not only that iterative searching requires one buffer only, but because procedure \code{Files.Old} and in turn \code{Search} may be called when the processor is in the supervisor mode and hence uses the system- (instead of the user-) stack, which is small and would not accommodate sector buffers.

Naturally, an updated page needs to be stored back onto disk. Omission of sector restoration is a programming error that is very hard to diagnose, because some parts of the program are executed very rarely, and hence the error may look sporadic and mistakenly be attributed to malfunctioning hardware.

Oberon's file directory represents a single, ordered set of name-file pairs. It is therefore also called a flat directory. Its internal tree structure is not visible to the outside. In contrast, some file systems use a directory with a visible tree structure, notably \acro{UNIX}. In a search, the name (key) guides the search path; the name itself displays structure, in fact, it is a sequence of names (usually separated by slashes or periods). The first name is then searched in the root directory, whose descendants are not files but subdirectories. The process is repeated, until the last name in the sequence has been used (and hopefully denotes a file).

Since the search path length in a tree increases with the logarithm of the number of elements, any subdivision of the tree inherently decreases performance since $\log{(m + n)} < \log{(m)} + \log{(n)}$ for any $m$, $n > 1$. It is justified only if there exist sets of elements with common properties. If these property values are stored once, namely in the subdirectory referencing all elements with common property values, instead of in every element, not only a gain in storage economy results, but possibly also in accesses which depend on those properties. The common properties are typically an owner's name, a password, and access rights (read or write protection), properties that primarily have significance in a multi-user environment. Since Oberon was conceived explicitly as a single-user system, there is little need for such facilities, and hence a flat directory offers the best performance with a simple implementation.

Every directory operation starts with an access to the root page. An obvious measure for improving efficiency is to store the root page ``permanently'' in main store. We have chosen not to do this for four reasons:

\item{1.} If the hardware fails, or if the computer is switched off before the root page is copied to disk, the file directory will be inconsistent with severe consequences.
\item{2.} The root page has to be treated differently from other pages, making the program more complex.
\item{3.} Directory accesses do not dominate the computing process; hence, any improvement would hardly be noticeable in overall system performance. The payoff for the added complexity would be small.
\item{4.} Procedure \code{Init} is called upon system initialization in order to construct the sector reservation table. Therefore, this procedure (and the module) must be allowed to refer to the structure of a file's sector table(s), which is achieved by placing its definitions into the module \code{FileDir} (instead of \code{Files}). Unlike \code{Enumerate}, \code{Init} traverses the entire B-tree. The sector numbers of files delivered by \code{TraverseDir} are entered into a buffer. When full, the entries are sorted, whereafter each file's head sector is read and the sectors indicated in its sector table are marked as reserved. The sorting speeds up the reading of the header sectors considerably. Nevertheless, the initialization of the sector reservation table clearly dominates the start-up time of the computer. For a file system with 10,000 files it takes in the order of 15s to record all files.

\beginsubsection 7.5. THE TOOLBOX OF FILE UTILITIES.

We conclude this Chapter with a presentation of the commands which constitute the toolbox for file handling. These commands are contained in the tool module \code{System}, and they serve to copy, rename, and delete files, and to obtain excerpts of the file directory.

Procedures \code{CopyFiles}, \code{RenameFiles}, and \code{DeleteFiles} all follow the same pattern. The parameter text is scanned for file names, and for each operation a corresponding procedure is called. If the parameter text contains an arrow, it is interpreted as a pointer to the most recent text selection which indicates the file name. In the cases of \code{CopyFiles} and \code{RenameFiles} which require two names for a single action, the names are separated by ``\code{=>}'' indicating the direction of the copy or rename actions.

Procedure \code{Directory} serves to obtain excerpts of the file directory. It makes use of procedure \code{FileDir.Enumerate}. The parametric procedure \code{List} tests whether or not the delivered name matches the pattern specified by the parameter of the directory command. If it matches, the name is listed in the text of the viewer opened in the system track. Since the pattern may contain one or several asterisks (wild cards), the test consists of a sequence of searches of the pattern parts (separated by the asterisks) in the file name. In order to reduce the number of calls of \code{List}, \code{Enumerate} is called with the first part of the pattern as parameter prefix. Enumeration then starts with the least name having the specified prefix, and terminates as soon as all names with this prefix have been scanned.

If the specified pattern is followed by an option directive ``\code{!}'', then not only file names are listed, but also the listed files' creation date and length. This requires that not only the directory sectors on the disk are traversed, but that additionally for each listed file its header sector must be read. The two procedures use the global variables \code{pat} and \code{diroption}.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 8: STORAGE LAYOUT AND MANAGEMENT.

\beginsubsection 8.1. LAYOUT AND RUN-TIME ORGANIZATION.

A crucial property of the Oberon System is centralized resource management. Its advantage is that replication of management algorithms and a premature partitioning of resources are avoided. The disadvantage is that management algorithms are fixed once and forever and remain the same for all applications. The success of a centralized resource management therefore depends crucially on its flexibility and its efficient implementation. This chapter presents the scheme and the algorithms governing main storage in the Oberon System.

The storage layout of the Oberon System is determined by the structure of code and data typical in the use of modular, high-level programming languages, and in particular of the language Oberon. It suggests the subdivision of storage into three areas.

1. The \emph{module space}. Every module specifies procedures (code) and global (static) variables. Its initialization part can be regarded as a procedure implicitly called after loading. Upon loading, space must be allocated for code and data. Typically, modules contain very few or no global variables, hence the size of the allocated space is primarily determined by the code. The combined code and data space is called a block. Blocks are allocated in the \emph{module space} by the loader.

2. The \emph{workspace} (stack). Execution of every command invokes a sequence of procedures, each of which uses (possibly zero) parameters and local variables. Since procedure calls and completions follow a strict first-in last-out order, the stack is the uniquely suited strategy for storage allocation for local data. Deallocation upon completion of a procedure is achieved by merely resetting the pointer identifying the top of the stack. Since this operation is performed by a single instruction, it costs virtually no time. Because Oberon is a single-process system, a single stack suffices. Furthermore, after completion of a command, the stack is empty. This fact will be important in simplifying the scheme for reclamation of dynamically allocated space.

3. The \emph{dynamic space} (heap). Apart from global (static) variables, and local (stack-allocated) variables, a program may refer to anonymous variables referenced through pointers. Such variables are allocated truly dynamically through calls of an explicit operation (\code{NEW}). These variables  allocated in the so-called \emph{heap}. Their deallocation is ``automatic'' when free storage is needed and they are no longer referenced from any of the loaded modules. This process is called \emph{garbage collection}. Every record allocated in the heap contains a (hidden) pointer to the descriptor of its type called the \emph{type tag}. It is used by the garbage collector.

Unfortunately, the number of distinct spaces is larger than two. If it were two, no arbitrary size limitation would be necessary; merely the sum of their sizes would be inherently limited by the size of the store. In the case of three spaces, arbitrarily determined size limits are unavoidable. Address-mapping hardware can alleviate (and delegate) this problem using a virtual address space which is so large that limits will hardly ever be reached.

Such a scheme is implemented by tables mapping virtual into physical addresses, requiring multiple memory accesses for every reference. Of course, the need for a double or a triple access for every memory reference is avoided by a translation cache in the (hardware) unit. Nevertheless, a decrease in performance is unavoidable for each cache miss. Furthermore, an additional subcycle is required for \emph{every} access in order to look up the cached translation table. Without a virtual address scheme, each module block must consist of an integral number of physically adjacent pages. Holes generated by the release of modules must be reused. We employ the simple scheme of marking the released space as a hole, and of allocating a new block in the first hole encountered that is large enough (first-fit strategy). Considering the relative infrequency of module releases, efforts to improve the strategy are not worth the resulting added complexity.

It is remarkable that the code for module allocation and release without virtual addressing is only marginally more complicated than with it. The only remaining advantages of an \MMU are a better storage utilization, because no holes occur (a negligible advantage), and that inadvertent references to unloaded modules, e.g. via installed procedures, lead to an invalid address trap.

It is worth recalling that the concept of address mapping was introduced as a requirement for virtual memory implemented with disks as backing store, where pages could be moved into the background in order to obtain space for newly required pages, and could then be retrieved from disk on demand, i.e. when access was requested. This scheme is called demand paging. It is not used in the Oberon system, and one may fairly state that demand paging has lost its significance with the availability of large, primary stores.

Experience in the use of the \RISC predecessor Ceres leads to the conclusion that whereas address translation through an \MMU was an essential feature for multi-user operating systems, it constitutes a dispensible overkill for single-user workstations. The fact that modern semiconductor technology made it possible to integrate the entire translation and caching scheme into a single chip, or even into the processor itself, led to the hiding (and ignoring) of the scheme's considerable complexity. Its side effects on execution speed are essentially unpredictable. This makes systems with \MMU virtually unusable for applications with tight real-time constraints. The \RISC processor does indeed not feature an address mapping unit.

The \RISC processor features 16 registers (of 32 bits). \code{R0}--\code{R11} are used for expression evaluation. \code{R12}--\code{R15} have fixed, system-wide usage:
{\narrower
\item{\code{R12}} address of the module table \code{MT} (typically constant)
\item{\code{R13}} base address for variables in the current module \code{SB} (static base)
\item{\code{R14}} stack pointer \code{SP}
\item{\code{R15}} return address \code{LNK} (fixed by \RISC's \code{BL} instruction)

}

\beginsubsection 8.2. MANAGEMENT OF DYNAMIC STORAGE.

The term \emph{dynamic storage} is used here for all variables that are allocated neither statically (global variables) nor on the stack (local variables), but through invocation of the intrinsic procedure \code{NEW}.

Such variables are anonymous and are referenced exclusively via pointers. The space in which they are allocated is called the \emph{heap}.

The space allocated to such dynamic variables becomes free and reusable as soon as the last reference to it vanishes. This event is hard, and in multiprocess systems even impossible to detect. The usual remedy is to ignore it and instead to determine the accessibility of all allocated variables (records, objects) only at the time when more storage space is needed. This process is then called \emph{garbage collection}.

The Oberon System does not provide an explicit deallocation procedure allowing the programmer to signal that a variable will no longer be referenced. The first reason for this omission is that usually a programmer would not know when to call for deallocation. And secondly, this ``hint'' could not be taken as trustworthy. An erroneous deallocation, i.e. one occurring when there still exist references to the object in question, could lead to a multiple allocation of the same space with disastrous consequences. Hence, it appears wise to fully rely on system management to determine which areas of the store are truly reusable.

Before discussing the scheme for storage reclamation, which is the primary subject of dynamic storage management, we turn our attention to the problem of allocation, i.e. the implementation of procedure \code{NEW}. The simplest solution is to maintain a list of free blocks and to pick the first one large enough. This strategy leads to a relatively large fragmentation of space and produces many small elements, particularly in the first part of the list. We therefore employ a somewhat more refined scheme and maintain four lists of available space. Three of them contain pieces of fixed size, namely 32, 64, and 128 bytes. The fourth list contains pieces whose size is any multiple of 256. We note that the choice of the values permits the merging of any two contiguous elements into an element of the next list. This scheme keeps fragmentation, i.e. the emergence of small pieces in large numbers, reasonably low with minimal effort. The body of procedure \code{NEW} consists of relatively few instructions, and typically only a small fraction of them needs to be executed.

The statement \code{NEW(p)} is compiled into an instruction sequence assigning the address of pointer variable \code{p} to a fixed register (\code{R0}) and the type tag to another register (\code{R1}). The type tag is a pointer to a type descriptor containing information required by the garbage collector. This includes the size of the space occupied and now to be allocated. The effect of \code{NEW} is the assignment of the address of the allocated block to \code{p}, and the assignment of the tag to a prefix of the block. (see Fig. 8.2)

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.2.png}{4.3in}{8.2}{Allocation of dynamic variable p^ in the heap by procedure \code{NEW(p)}}

In conclusion, we emphasize that this scheme makes the allocation of an object very efficient. Nevertheless, it is considerably more costly than that of a variable explicitly declared and therefore allocated either globally or on the stack.

We now turn to the problem of storage reclamation or garbage collection. There exist two essentially different schemes: the reference counting and the mark-scan schemes. In the former, every object carries a (hidden) reference count, indicating the number of existing references to it. The scheme works as follows:

1. \code{NEW(p)} initializes the reference count of \code{p\^} to 1.

2. An assignment \code{q := p} decrements the reference count of \code{q\^} by 1, performs the assignment, then increments the reference count of \code{p\^} by 1. When a reference count reaches zero, the element is linked into the free list.

There are two disadvantages inherent in this approach. The first is the non-negligible overhead in pointer assignments. The second is that circular data structures never become recognized as free, even if no external references point to their elements.

The Oberon system employs the second scheme which involves no hidden operations like the reference counting scheme, but relies on a process initiated when free storage has become scarce and more is needed. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, all referenced and therefore still accessible elements are marked. In the second phase, their unmarked complement is released. The first phase is called the \emph{mark phase}, the second the \emph{scan phase}. Its primary disadvantage is that the process may be started at moments unpredictable to the system's user. During the process, the computer then appears to be blocked. It follows that an interactive system using \emph{mark-scan garbage collection} must guarantee that the process is sufficiently fast in order to be hardly noticeable. Modern processors make this possible, even with large main stores. Nevertheless, finding all accessible nodes in an entire computer system within, say, a second appears to be a formidable feat.

We recognize that the mark phase essentially is a tree traversal, or rather a forest traversal. The roots of the trees are all named pointer variables in existence. We shall postpone the question of how these roots are to be found, and first present a quick tutorial about tree traversal. In general, nodes of the traversed structure may contain many pointers (branches). We shall, however, first restrict our attention to a binary tree, because the essential problem and its solution can be explained better in this way.

The essential problem alluded to is that of storage utilization by the traversal algorithm itself. Typically, information about the nodes already visited must be retained, be it explicitly, or implicitly as in the case of use of recursion. Such a strategy is plainly unacceptable, because the amount of storage needed is unpredictable and may become very large, and because garbage collection is typically initiated just when more storage is unavailable. The task may seem impossible, yet a solution lies in the idea of inverting pointers along the path traversed, thus keeping the return path open. It is embodied in the following procedure, whose task is to traverse the tree given by the parameter root, and to mark every node. Mark values are assumed to be initially 0. Let the data structure be defined by the types
\begintt
Ptr = POINTER TO Node;
Node = RECORD m: INTEGER; L, R: Ptr END;
\endtt

\noindent and the algorithm by the procedure
\begintt
PROCEDURE traverse(root: Ptr); VAR p, q, r; Ptr;
BEGIN p := root; q := root;
  REPEAT (* p # NIL *) INC(p.m); (*mark*)
    IF p.L # NIL THEN (*pointer rotation*)
      r := p.L; p.L := p.R; p.R := q; q := p; p := r
    ELSE
      p.L := p.R; p.R := q; q:= NIL
    END
  UNTIL p = q
END traverse
\endtt

\noindent We note that only three local variables are required, independent of the size of the tree to be traversed. The third, \code{r}, is in fact merely an auxiliary variable to perform the rotation of values \code{p.L}, \code{p.R}, \code{q}, and \code{p} as shown in Fig. 8.3. A snapshot of a tree traversal is shown in Fig. 8.4.

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.3.png}{1.2in}{8.3}{Rotation of four pointers}
\figure{pdfs/fig-8.4.png}{4.7in}{8.4}{Tree traversal (original at left, snapshot at right)}

The pair \code{p}, \code{q} of pointers marks the position of the process. The algorithm traverses the tree in a left to right, depth first fashion. When it returns to the root, all nodes have been marked.

How are these claims convincingly supported? The best way is by analyzing the algorithm at an arbitrary node. We start with the hypothesis $H$ that, given the initial state $P$, the algorithm will reach state $Q$, (see Fig 8.5).

State $Q$ differs from $P$ by the node and its descendants $B$ and $C$ having been marked, and by an exchange of \code{p} and \code{q}. We now apply the algorithm to state $P$, assuming that $B$ and $C$ are not empty. The process is illustrated in Fig 8.5. $P0$ stands for $P$ in Fig. 8.4.

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.5.png}{3.3in}{8.5}{Transition from state $P$ to $Q$}

Transitions $P0 \to P1$, $P2 \to P3$, and $P4 \to P5$ are the direct results of applying the pointer rotation as specified by the sequence of five assignments in the algorithm. Transitions $P1 \to P2$ and $P3 \to P4$ follow from the hypothesis $H$ being applied to the states $P1$ and $P3$: subtrees are marked and \code{p}, \code{q} interchanged. We note in passing that the node is visited three times. Progress is recorded by the mark value which is incremented from 0 to 3.

Fig. 8.6. demonstrates that, if $H$ holds for steps $P1 \to P2$ and $P3 \to P4$, then it also holds for step $P0 \to P5$, which visits the subtree \code{p}. Hence, it also holds for the step $root \to root$, which traverses the entire tree.

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.6.png}{3.7in}{8.6}{Transitions from $P0$ to $P5$, visiting nodes 3 times}

This proof by recursion relies on the algorithm performing correct transitions also in the case of \code{p.L} being \code{NIL}, i.e. \code{B} being the empty tree. In this case, state $P1$ is skipped; the first transition is $P0 \to P2$ (see Figure 8.7).

If \code{p.L} is again \code{NIL}, i.e. also \code{C} is empty, the next transition is $P2 \to P4$. This concludes the demonstration of the algorithm's correctness.

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.7.png}{3.7in}{8.7}{Direct transition from $P0$ to $P2$, if \code{p.L = NIL}}

We now modify the algorithm of tree traversal to the case where the structure is not confined to a binary tree, but may be a tree of any degree, i.e. each node may have any number n of descendants. For practical purposes, however, we restrict n to be in the range $0 \le n \le N$, and therefore may represent all nodes by the type
\begintt
Node = RECORD
  m, n: INTEGER;
  dsc: ARRAY N OF Node
END
\endtt
\noindent In principle, the binary tree traversal algorithm might be adopted almost without change, merely extending the rotation of pointers from $p.L$, $p.R$, $q$, $p$ to $p.dsc[0], ... , p.dsc[n-1]$, $q$, $p$. However, this would be an unnecessarily inefficient solution. The following is a more effective variant. Moreover, it caters for the case of inhomogeneous graphs, where different nodes have different numbers of descendants. The key lies in associating with every node, in addition to the tag, a second private field \code{mk}. It serves two purposes. The first is as a mark, with $mk > 0$ indicating that the node had been visited. The second is to store the address of the next descendant to be visited. The underlying data structure is shown in Figure 8.8. Type descriptors consist of the following fields:

\item{\bullet} size in bytes, of the described record type,
\item{\bullet} base a table of pointers to the descriptors of the base types (3 elements only)
\item{\bullet} offsets of the descendant pointers in the described type (1 word each)

\noindent We note that the mark value, starting with zero (unmarked), is used as a counter of descendants already traversed, and hence as an index to the descendant field to be processed next. The algorithm can be applied not only to trees, but to arbitrary structures, including circular ones, if the continuation condition \code{p \# 0} (actually \code{p >= heapOrg}) is extended to \code{(p >= heapOrg) \& (offadr = 0)}. This causes a descendant that is already marked to be skipped. Here the array \code{M} stands for the entire memory.

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.8.png}{2.7in}{8.8}{Record and its type descriptor}

\begintt
PROCEDURE traverse(root: Ptr);
  VAR offadr, offset: INTEGER;
  p, q, r: Ptr;
BEGIN p := root; q := root;
  REPEAT (* p # NIL*) offadr := p.mk; (*mark*)
    IF offadr = 0 THEN tag := p.tg; offadr := tag + 16 ELSE INC(offadr, 4) END ;
    p. mk := offadr; offset := M[offadr];
    IF offset # -1 THEN (*move down*)
      r := M[p+offset]; offadr := M[r-4];;
      IF offadr = 0 THEN M[p+offset] := q; q := p; p := r END
    ELSE (*move up*)
      offadr := M[q-4];offset := M[offadr]
      IF p # q THEN r := M[q+offset]; M[q+offset] := p; p := q; q := r END
    END
  UNTIL (p = q) & (offset = -1)
END traverse;
\endtt

\noindent The mark is included in each record's hidden prefix. The prefix takes 2 words only; the first is used for the tag. The other is reserved for the garbage collector and used as mark and offset address. The end of the list of descendant pointers is marked by an entry with value -1. And finally, assignments involving \code{M} are expressed as

\item{} \code{SYSTEM.GET(a, x)} for \code{x := M[a]}
\item{} \code{SYSTEM.PUT(a, x)} for \code{M[a] := x}

The scan phase is performed by a relatively straight-forward algorithm. The heap, i.e. the storage area between \code{HeapOrg} and \code{HeapLimit} (the latter is a variable), is scanned element by element, starting at \code{HeapOrg}. Elements marked are unmarked, and unmarked elements are freed by linking them into the appropriate list of available space.

As the heap may always contain free elements, the scan phase must be able to recognize them in order to skip them or merge them with an adjacent free element. For this purpose, the free elements are also considered as prefixed. The prefix serves to determine the element's size and to recognize it as free due to a special (negative) mark value. The encountered mark values and the action to be taken are:
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
mk value & state & action\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
\code{= 0} &     unmarked &  collect, mark free \cr
\code{> 0} &     marked   &  unmark \cr
\code{< 0} &     free     &  skip or merge \cr
}\medskip
\beginsubsection 8.3. THE KERNEL.

The kernel lies at the bottom of the module hierarchy. It contains the procedures for dynamic storage allocation and retrieval as described before. The procedures are \code{New}, \code{Mark}, and \code{Scan}.

\code{Kernel} also contains the driver routines for the disk. They are used by modules \code{FileDir} and \code{Files}. The ``disk'' is actually an \acro{SD}-card, a high-volume flash-\acro{RAM}. It is accessed purely sequentially, byte-wise, by a standard, serial peripheral interface (\acro{SPI}). Within \code{Kernel} a table called \code{SectorMap} is allocated keeping track of blocks (sectors) occupied by files. A single bit indicates, whether a sector is allocated or not. This table is accessed by the procedures \code{AllocSector}, \code{MarkSector}, and \code{FreeSector}. Reading and writing is done sector-wise by procedures \code{GetSector} and \code{PutSector}. Sector numbers are always a multiple of 29 for the purpose of redundancy checks.

Furthermore, the kernel contains a timer counting milliseconds and, perhaps, a real time clock, showing date and time. Clock data are packed into a single word as follows:

\figure{pdfs/fig-8.9.png}{4.3in}{8.9}{Encoding of date and time (year starting with 2000)}

\begintt

END Kernel.
\endtt

\beginsubsection 8.4. THE STORAGE MANAGEMENT'S TOOLBOX.

The user can obtain information about the system's state and resources through its toolbox, a set of commands contained in the too module \code{System}. These commands are:
\begintt
PROCEDURE Watch;
PROCEDURE Collect; / n
PROCEDURE SetClock; / year, month, day, hour, minute, second
\endtt

\noindent Command \code{Watch} shows the amount of storage occupied in the heap, the number of disk sectors allocated on the disk, and the number of tasks installed. The command \code{Collect} allows to control the frequency of garbage collections. The number \code{n} indicates how many commands are executed before the next garbage collection.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 9: DEVICE DRIVERS.

\beginsubsection 9.1. OVERVIEW.

Device drivers are collections of procedures that constitute the immediate interface between hardware and software. They refer to those parts of the computer hardware that are usually called \emph{peripheral}. Computers typically contain a system bus which transmits data among its different parts. Processor and memory are considered as its internal parts; the remaining parts, such as disk, keyboard, display, etc, are considered as external or peripheral, notwithstanding the fact that they are often contained in the same cabinet or board.

Such peripheral devices are connected to the system bus via special registers (data buffers) and transceivers (switches, buffers in the sense of digital electronics). These registers and transceivers are addressed by the processor in the same way as memory locations---they are said to be \emph{memory-mapped}---and they constitute the hardware interface between processor bus and device. References to them are typically confined to specific driver procedures which constitute the software interface.

Drivers are inherently hardware specific, and the justification of their existence is precisely that they encapsulate these specifics and present to their clients an appropriate abstraction of the device. Evidently, this abstraction must still reflect the essential characteristics of the device, but not the details (such as e.g. the addresses of its interface registers).

Our justification to present the drivers connecting the Oberon system with the \RISC computer in detail is on the one hand the desire for completeness. But on the other hand it is also in recognition of the fact that their design represents an essential part of the engineering task in building a system. This part may look trivial from a conceptual point of view; it certainly is not so in practice.

In order to reduce the number of interface types, standards have been established. The \RISC computer also uses such interface standards, and we will concentrate on them in the following presentations. The following devices are presented:

1. The \emph{Keyboard} is considered as a serial device delivering one byte of input data per key stroke. It is connected by a serial line according to the \acro{PS}/2 and \ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) standards. The software is contained in module \code{Input} (Sect. 9.2), and the hardware is explained in Sect. 17.2.1.

2. The \emph{mouse} is a pointing device delivering coordinates in addition to key states. The software is also part of module \code{Input} (Sect. 9.2).

3. \emph{Display}. The interface to the display is an area of memory that contains the displayed information, exactly one bit per pixel for a monochrome display. This area is called frame buffer or bitmap Here the size is of the display area is 768 lines and 1024 dots per line, representing a raster. The software is module Display, which primarily consists of operations to draw frequently occurring patterns. These operations are called raster-ops. They are explained in Section 4.5. The actual display requires a hardware interface called a display controller. The connection between the controller and the display follows the \acro{VGA}-Standard (see Sect. 17.2.4).

4. \emph{Disk}. Our \RISC computer does not use a magnetic, rotating disk for storing non-volatile data. Instead, it uses an \acro{SD}-card (flash-\acro{RAM}). The driver is contained in module \code{Kernel} (Section 8.3). The hardware is discussed in Sect. 17.2.2.

5. \emph{Net}. In the original text, a network was presented consisting of a bus connecting many computers, based on the \acro{RS}-485 standard. It was implemented by the serial communications controller Zilog 8530, operating at a frequency of 230 Kb/s. The name \acro{SCC} has been retained as a generic interface, behind which the packet transport has now been re-implemented as a simple wireless network (Nordic nRF24L01 controller) in the regulation-free 2.4GHz industrial/scientific/medical (\acro{ISM}) frequency band.

In all driver modules the implementation-dependent procedures \code{SYSTEM.PUT}, \code{SYSTEM.GET}, and \code{SYSTEM.BIT} are used to access the registers of the device interface. Their first parameter is the address of the register, the second an expression or variable.

\beginsubsection 9.2. KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.

The driver procedures for the keyboard and the mouse are located in module \code{Input}. \code{Available()} signals that a character has been typed on the keyboard, if its value is greater than 0. The character is read by calling \code{Read(ch)}. Module \code{Input} is restricting the data to the \ASCII character set Latin-1, i.e. the values lie in the range $0X \ge ch < 80X$ (7-bit values). \code{Mouse(k, x, y)} yields the current state of the mouse keys and the mouse's coordinates.
\begintt
MODULE Input;
PROCEDURE Available(): INTEGER;
PROCEDURE Read(VAR ch: CHAR);
PROCEDURE Mouse(VAR keys: SET; VAR x, y: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE SetMouseLimits(w, h: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Init;
END Input.
\endtt

\noindent The driver software accesses the keyboard via the Standard \acro{PS}/2 interface represented by an 8-bit register for the received data \code{kbdCode}, and a single-bit flag indicating whether a byte had been received.

The keyboard codes received from the keyboard via a \acro{PS}/2 line are not identical with the character values delivered to the \code{Read} procedure. A conversion is necessary. This is so, because modern keyboards treat all keys in the same way, including the ones for upper case, control, alternative, etc. Separate codes are sent to signal the pushing down and the release of a key, followed by another code identifying which key had been pressed or released. This requires, besides a translation table from codes to characters, a set of state variables. They are the global, \code{Boolean} variables \code{Recd}, \code{Up}, \code{Shift}, \code{Ctrl}, and \code{Ext}. Procedure \code{Peek} determines whether an actual character is present, or merely a code signalling a key shift. \code{Peek} controls the state.

Procedure \code{Mouse} fetches a word from the mouse interface register and decomposes it into its components (key state and coordinates). (\code{kb} is the bit indicating whether a code had been received from the keyboard).

\figure{pdfs/fig-9.1.png}{2.3in}{9.1}{Format of the mouse register}

\beginsubsection 9.3. THE SD-CARD (DISK).

\acro{SD}-card are high-volume memory devices based on flash-store technology. They are typically organized as individually accessible blocks of 1K bytes. The driver for the \acro{SD}-card is contained in module \code{Kernel}, which also handles allocation and reservation of blocks, here in analogy to rotating disks still called sectors.
\begintt
TYPE Sector = ARRAY SectorLength OF BYTE;
PROCEDURE GetSector(src: INTEGER; VAR dst: Sector);
PROCEDURE PutSector(dst: INTEGER; VAR src: Sector);
PROCEDURE AllocSector(hint: INTEGER; VAR sec: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE MarkSector(sec: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE FreeSector(sec: INTEGER);
\endtt

\noindent Data transfer is sequential and handled by procedures \code{ReadSD} and \code{WriteSD} by issuing commands. These are for transmitting a block address, for receiving, and for sending a block of data. Synchronous transmission of sequences of words follows the \acro{SPI} standard, which uses 3 lines, one for data input, one for data output, and one for the clock (see also Section 17.2.2). The hardware interface contains a 32-bit register. The bit-rate is 8.3 \acro{MB}/s.

\beginsubsection 9.4. SERIAL ASYNCHRONOUS INTERFACE (RS 232).

The \acro{RS}-232 standard serves to transmit sequences of bytes over a data line asynchronously. This implies that there is no separate clock line (see also Section 17.2.3). The hardware interface contains a 10-bit register for the transmitter and one for the receiver. The data rate used here is 19200 bit/s. A byte is sent and received over the line by the following programs.
\begintt
CONST data = -56; stat = -52; (*device register addresses*)
PROCEDURE Send(x: BYTE);
BEGIN
  REPEAT UNTIL SYSTEM.BIT(stat, 1);
  SYSTEM.PUT(data, x)
END Send;

PROCEDURE Rec(VAR x: BYTE);
BEGIN
  REPEAT UNTIL SYSTEM.BIT(stat, 0);
  SYSTEM.GET(data, x)
END Rec;
\endtt

\noindent These procedures are used in the driver module \code{RS232} presented in Section 15.2. This module itself is not used in the Oberon core, but it was instrumental in building the System on a host computer and downloading it. It is characterized by a very simple interface.

\beginsubsection 9.5. SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS CONTROLLER (SCC).

The interface of the driver for the network was taken over from the original design using a serial communocations controller Zilog 8530. The implementation changed totally. It was designed by Paul Reed for the wireless controller Nordic nRF24L01.
\begintt
DEFINITION SCC;
TYPE Header =
  RECORD valid: BOOLEAN; dadr, sadr, typ: BYTE;
    len: INTEGER; (*of data following header*)
  END;
  
PROCEDURE Start(filter: BOOLEAN);
PROCEDURE Send(VAR head: Header; buf: ARRAY OF BYTE);
PROCEDURE Available(): INTEGER;
PROCEDURE ReceiveHead(VAR head: Header);
PROCEDURE Receive(VAR x: BYTE);
PROCEDURE Skip(m: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE Stop;
END SCC.
\endtt

\beginchapter CHAPTER 10: THE NETWORK.

\beginsubsection 10.1. INTRODUCTION.

Workstations are typically, but not always, connected in a local environment by a network. There exist two basically different views of the architecture of such nets. The more demanding view is that all connected stations constitute a single, unified workspace (also called address-space), in which the individual processors operate. It implies the demand that the ``thin'' connections between processors are hidden from the users. At worst they might become apparent through slower data access rates between the machines. To hide the difference between access within a computer and access between computers is regarded primarily as a challenge to implementors.

The second, more conservative view, assumes that individual workstations are, although connected, essentially autonomous units which exchange data infrequently. Therefore, access of data on partner stations is initiated by explicit transfer commands. Commands handling external access are not part of the basic system, but rather are implemented in modules that might be regarded as applications.

In the Oberon System, we adhere to this second view, and in this chapter, we describe the module \code{Net}, which is an autonomous command module based on the network driver \code{SCC}. It can be activated on any station connected in a network, and all of them are treated as equals. Such a set of loosely coupled stations may well operate in networks with moderate transmission rates and therefore with low-cost hardware interfaces and twisted-pair wires.

An obvious choice for the unit of transferred data is the file. The central theme of this chapter is therefore file transfer over a network. Some additional facilities offered by a dedicated server station will be the subject of Chapter 11. The commands to be presented here are a few only: \code{SendFiles}, \code{ReceiveFiles}, and \code{SendMsg}.

As explained in Chapter 2, Oberon is a single-process system where every command monopolizes the processor until termination. When a command involves communication over a network, (at least) two processors are engaged in the action at the same time. The Oberon paradigm therefore appears to exclude such cooperation; but fortunately it does not, and the solution to the problem is quite simple.

Every command is initiated by a user operating on a workstation. For the moment we call it the master (of the command under consideration). The addressed station---obviously called the server---must be in a state where it recognizes the command in order to engage in its execution. Since the command---called a request---arrives in encoded form over the network, an Oberon task represented by a handler procedure must be inserted into the event polling loop of the system. Such a handler must have the general form
\begintt
IF event present THEN handle event END
\endtt

\noindent The guard, in this case, must imply that a request was received from the network. We emphasize that the event is sensed by the server only after the command currently under execution, if any, has terminated. However, data arrive at the receiver immediately after they are sent by the master. Hence, any sizeable delay is inherently inadmissible, and the Oberon metaphor once again appears to fail. It does not fail, however, because the unavoidable, genuine concurrency of sender and receiver action is handled within the driver module which places the data into a buffer. The driver is activated by an interrupt, and its receiver buffer effectively decouples the partners and removes the stringent timing constraints. All this remains completely hidden within the driver module.

\beginsubsection 10.2. THE PROTOCOL.

If more than a single agent participates in the execution of a command, a convention must be established and obeyed. It defines the set of requests, their encoding, and the sequence of data exchanges that follow. Such a convention is called a protocol. Since in our metaphor, actions initiated by the master and the server strictly follow each other in alternation, the protocol can be defined using \acro{EBNF} (extended Backus-Naur formalism), well-known from the syntax specification of languages. Items originating from the master will be written with normal font, those originating from the server appear in italics. {\bf TODO: Fix, this isn't true anymore}

A simple form of the \code{ReceiveFile} request is defined as follows and will be refined subsequently:

\code{ReceiveFile} = $\underbrace{\code{SND} filename}_{client} \underbrace{(\code{ACK}\ data \mid \code{NAK})}_{server}$


\noindent Here, the symbol \code{SND} represents the encoded request that the server send the file specified by the file name. \code{ACK} signals that the request is honoured and the requested data follow. The \code{NAK} symbol indicates that the requested file cannot be delivered. The transaction clearly consists of two parts, the request and the reply, one from each partner.

This simple-minded scheme fails because of the limitation of the size of each transmitted portion imposed by the network driver. We recall that module \code{SCC} restricts the data of each packet to 512 bytes. Evidently, files must be broken up and transmitted as a sequence of packets. The reason for this restriction is transmission reliability. The break-up allows the partner to confirm correct receipt of a packet by returning a short acknowledgement. Each acknowledgement also serves as request for the next packet. An exception is the last acknowledgement following the last data portion, which is characterized by its length being less than the admitted maximum. The revised protocol is defined as

\code{ReceiveFile} = $\underbrace{\code{SND}\ filename}_{client} (\underbrace{\code{DAT}\ data}_{server} \underbrace{\code{ACK}}_{client} {\underbrace{\code{DAT}\ data}_{server}\ \underbrace{\code{ACK}}_{client}} \mid \underbrace{\code{NAK}}_{server})$


\noindent We now recall that each packet as defined in Section 9.3. {\bf WRONG, it was true in the 2005 edition but this edition doesn't have any network packet info.} is characterized by a type in its header. The symbols \code{SND}, \code{DAT}, \code{ACK}, and \code{NAK} indicate this packet type. The data portions of \code{ACK} and \code{NAK} packets are empty.

The revised protocol fails to cope with transmission errors. Correct transmission is checked by the driver through a cyclic redundancy check (\acro{CRC}), and an erroneous packet is simple discarded. This implies that a receiver must impose a timing constraint. If an expected packet fails to arrive within a given time period (timeout), the request must be repeated. In our case, a request is implied by an acknowledgement. Hence, the acknowledgement must specify whether the next (normal case) or the previously requested (error case) packet must be sent. The solution is to attach a sequence number to each acknowledgement and to each data packet. These numbers are taken modulo 8, although in principle modulo 2 would suffice.

With the addition of a user identification and a password to every request, and of an alternate reply code \code{NPR} for ``no permission'', the protocol reaches its final form:
\begintt
ReceiveFile = SND username password filename (datastream | NAK | NPR).
datastream = DAT0 data ACK1 {DATi data ACKi+1}.
\endtt

\noindent The protocol for file transmission from the master to the server is defined similarly:
\begintt
SendFile = REC username password filename (ACK0 datastream | NAK | NPR).
datastream = DAT0 data ACK1 {DATi data ACKi+1}.
\endtt

\noindent The third request listed above, SendMsg, does not refer to any file, but merely transmits and displays a short message. It is included here for testing the link between two partners and perhaps for visibly acknowledging a rendered service by the message ``done'', or ``thank you''.
\begintt
SendMsg = MSG message ACK.
\endtt

\beginsubsection 10.3. STATION ADDRESSING.

Every packet must carry a destination address as well as the sender's address. Addresses are station numbers. It would certainly be inconvenient for a user to remember the station number of a desired partner. Instead, the use of symbolic names is preferred. We have become accustomed to use the partner's initials for this purpose.

The source address is inserted automatically into packet headers by the driver. It is obtained from a dip switch set when a computer is installed and connected. But where should the destination address come from? From the start we reject the solution of an address table in every workstation because of the potential inconsistencies. The concept of a centralized authority holding a name/address dictionary is equally unattractive, because of the updates required whenever a person uses a different computer. Also, we have started from the premise to keep all participants in the network equal.

The most attractive solution lies in a decentralized name service. It is based on the broadcast facility, i.e. the possibility to send a packet to all connected stations, bypassing their address filters with a special destination address (-1). The broadcast is used for emitting a name request containing the desired partner's symbolic name. A station receiving the request returns a reply to the requester, if that name matches its own symbolic name. The requester then obtains the desired partner's address from the source address field of the received reply. The corresponding simple protocol is:
\begintt
NameRequest = NRQ partnername [NRS].
\endtt

\noindent Here, the already mentioned timeout facility is indispensible. The following summarizes the protocol developed so far:
\begintt
protocol = {request}.
request = ReceiveFile | SendFile | SendMsg | NameRequest.
\endtt

\noindent The overhead incurred by name requests may be reduced by using a local address dictionary. In practice, a single entry is satisfactory. A name request is then needed whenever the partner changes.

\beginsubsection 10.4. THE IMPLEMENTATION.

Module \code{Net} is an implementation of the facilities outlined above. The program starts with a number of auxiliary, local procedures. They are followed by procedure Serve which is to be installed as an Oberon task, and the commands \code{SendFiles}, \code{ReceiveFiles}, and \code{SendMsg}, each of which has its counterpart within procedure \code{Serve}. At the end are the commands for starting and stopping the server facility.

For a more detailed presentation we select procedure \code{ReceiveFiles}. It starts out by reading the first parameter which designates the partner station from the command line. Procedure \code{FindPartner} issues the name request, unless the partner's address has already been determined by a previous command. The global variable partner records a symbolic name (id) whose address is stored in the destination field of the global variable \code{head0}, which is used as header in every packet sent by procedure \code{SCC.SendPacket}. The variable partner may be regarded as a name cache with a single entry and with the purpose of reducing the number of issued name requests.

If the partner has been identified, the next parameter is read from the command line. It is the name of the file to be transmitted. If the parameter has the form name0:name1, the file stored on the server as \code{name0.name1} is fetched and stored locally as \code{name1}. Hence, \code{name0} serves as a prefix of the file name on the server station.

Thereafter, the request parameters are concatenated in the local buffer variable \code{buf}. They are the user's name and password followed by the file name. (User name and password remain unused by the server presented here). The command package is dispatched by the call \code{Send(SND, k, buf)}, where \code{k} denotes the length of the command parameter string. Then the reply packet is awaited by calling \code{ReceiveHead}. If the received packet's type is \code{DAT} with sequence number 0, a new file is established. Procedure \code{ReadData} receives the data and stores them in the new file, obeying the protocol defined in Section 10.2. This process is repeated for each file specified in the list of file names in the command line.

Procedure \code{ReceiveHead(T)} receives packets and discards them until one arrives from the partner from which it is expected. The procedure represents an input filter in addition to the one provided by the hardware. It discriminates on the basis of the packets' source address, whereas the hardware filter discriminates on the basis of the destination address. If no packet arrives within the allotted time \code{T}, a type code -1 is returned, signifying a timeout.

Procedure \code{ReceiveData} checks the sequence numbers of incoming data packets (type 0 - 7). If an incorrect number is detected, an \acro{ACK}-packet with the previous sequence number is returned (type 16 - 23), requesting a retransmission. At most two retries are undertaken. This seems to suffice considering that also the server does not accept any other requests while being engaged in the transmission of a file.

The part corresponding to \code{ReceiveFiles} within procedure \code{Serve} is guarded by the condition \code{head1.typ} \equiv \code{ SND}. Variable \code{head1} is the recipient of headers whenever a packet is received by \code{ReceiveHead}. First, the request's parameters are scanned. \code{Id} and \code{pw} are ignored. Then the requested file is opened. If it exists, the transmission is handled by \code{ReceiveData's} counterpart, procedure \code{SendData}. The time limit for receiving the next request is \code{T1}, whereas the limit of \code{ReceiveData} for receiving the next data packet is \code{T0}. \code{T1} is roughly \code{T0} multiplied by the maximum number of possible (re)transmissions. Before disengaging itself from a transaction, the sender of data waits until no further retransmission requests can be expected to arrive. The value \code{T0} (300) corresponds to 1s; the time for transmission of a packet of maximum length is about 16ms.

Procedure \code{SendFiles} is designed analogously; its counterpart in the server is guarded by the condition \code{head1.typ} \equiv \code{ REC}. The server accepts the request only if its state is unprotected (global variable \code{protected}). Otherwise the request is negatively acknowledged with an \code{NPR} packet. We draw attention to the fact that procedures \code{SendData} and \code{ReceiveData} are both used by command procedures as well as by the server.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 11: A DEDICATED FILE-DISTRIBUTION AND MAIL SERVER.

\beginsubsection 11.1. CONCEPT AND STRUCTURE.

In a system of loosely coupled workstations it is desirable to centralize certain services. A first example is a common file store. Even if every station is equipped with a disk for permanent data storage, a common file service is beneficial, e.g. for storing the most recent versions of system files, reference documents, reports, etc. A common repository avoids inconsistencies which are inevitable when local copies are created. We call this a file distribution service.

A centralized service is also desirable if it requires equipment whose cost and service would not warrant its acquisition for every workstation, particularly if the service is infrequently used. A prime example of this case is a printing service.

The third case is a communication facility in the form of electronic mail. The repository of messages must inherently be centralized. We imagine it to have the form of a set of mailboxes, one for each user in the system. A mailbox needs to be accessible at all times, i.e. also when its owner's workstation has been switched off.

A last example of a centralized service is a time server. It allows a station's real time clock to be synchronized with a central clock.

In passing we point out that every user has full control over his station, including the right to switch it on and off at any time. In contrast, the central server is continuously operational.

In this chapter, we present a set of server modules providing all above mentioned services. They rest on the basic Oberon System without module \code{Net} (see Chapter 10). In contrast to \code{Net}, module \code{NetServer}, which handles all network communication, contains no command procedures (apart from those for starting and stopping it). This is because it never acts as a master. The counterparts of its server routines reside in other modules, including (an extended version of) \code{Net}, on the individual workstations.

Routines for the file distribution service are the same as those contained in module \code{Net}, with the addition of permission checks based on the received user names and passwords. Routines for printing and mail service could in principle also be included in \code{NetServer} in the same way. But considerations of reliability and timing made this simple solution appear as unattractive. A weaker coupling in time of data transmission and data consumption is indeed highly desirable. Therefore, data received for printing or for dispatching into mailboxes are stored (by \code{NetServer}) into temporary files and thereafter ``handed over'' to the appropriate agent, i.e. the print server or the mail server.

This data-centered interface between servers---in contrast to procedural inter\-faces---has the advantage that the individual servers are independent in the sense that none imports any other. Therefore, their development could proceed autonomously. Their connection is instead a module which defines a data structure and associated operators for passing temporary files from one server to another. The data structure used for this purpose is the first-in-first-out queue. We call its elements tasks, because each one carries an objective and an object, the file to be processed. The module containing the \acro{FIFO}s is called \code{Core}. The resulting structure of the involved modules is shown in Fig. 11.1.

Fig. 11.1. includes yet another server, \code{LineServer}, and shows the ease with which additional servers may be inserted in this scheme. They act as further sources and/or sinks for tasks, feeding or consuming the queues contained in \code{Core}. \code{LineServer} indeed produces and consumes tasks like \code{NetServer}. Instead of the \acro{RS}-485 bus, it handles the \acro{RS}-232 line which, connected to a modem, allows access to the server over telephone lines. We refrain from describing this module in further detail, because in many ways it is a mirror of \code{NetServer}.

A centralized, open server calls for certain protection measures against unauthorized use. We recall that requests always carry a user identification and a password as parameters. The server checks their validity by examining a table of users. The respective routines and the table are contained in module \code{Core} (see Sect. 11.5).

\beginsubsection 11.2. ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE.

The heart of an e-mail service is the set of mailboxes stored on the dedicated, central server. Each registered user owns a mailbox. The evidently necessary operations are the insertion of a message and its retrieval. In contrast to customary letter boxes, however, a retrieved message need not necessarily be removed from the box; its retrieval produces a copy. The box thereby automatically becomes a repository, and messages can be retrieved many times. This scheme calls for an additional command which removes a message from the box. Also, a command is needed for delivering a table of contents, in which presumably each message is represented by an indication of its sender and time of arrival.

The mail scheme suggested above results in the following commands:

\code{Net.Mailbox ServerName}. This command fetches a table of contents of the current user's mailbox from the specified server and displays it in a new viewer. The user's name and password must have been registered previously by the command System.SetUser.

\code{Net.SendMail ServerName}. The text in the marked viewer is sent to the specified server. In order to be accepted, the text must begin with at least one line beginning with ``\code{To:}'' and containing at least one recipient.

\code{Net.ReceiveMail}. This command is contained in the title bar (menu) of the viewer obtained when requesting the table of contents. Prior to issuing the command, the message to be read must have been specified by selecting a line in the table of contents in this viewer.

\code{Net.DeleteMail}. This command is also contained in the mailbox viewer's title bar. The message to be deleted must be selected before issuing the command.

The mail system presented here is primarily intended to serve as an exchange for short messages which are typically sent, received, read, and discarded. Mailboxes are not intended to serve as long term archives for a large and ever growing number of long pieces of text. This restrictiveness of purpose allows to choose a reasonably simple implementation and results in an efficient, practically instantaneous access to messages when the server is idle.

The Oberon mail server used at \acro{ETH} also provides communication with external correspondents. It connects to an external mail server which is treated as a source and a sink for messages (almost) like other customers. Additionally, messages sent to that server need to be encoded into a standardized format, and those received need to be decoded accordingly. The parts of module MailServer for encoding and decoding are not described in this book. We merely divulge the fact that its design and implementation took a multiple of the time spent on the fast, local message exchange, to which we confine this presentation.

From the structures explained in Section 11.1. it follows that three agents are involved in the transfer of messages from the user into a mailbox. Therefore, additions to the server system distribute over three modules. New commands are added to module \code{Net} (see Section 10.4.); these procedures will be listed below. Their counterparts reside in module \code{NetServer} on the dedicated computer. The third agent is module \code{MailServer}; both are listed below in this Section. The latter handles the insertion of arriving messages into mailboxes. The path which a message traverses for insertion and retrieval is shown in Fig. 11.2. Rectangles with bold edges mark storage.

TODO: Fig
% \figure{pdfs/fig-11.2.png}{4.3in}{11.2}{Path of messages to and from mailbox}

Communication between the master station and the dedicated server runs over the network and therefore calls for an extension of its protocol (see Sect. 10.2.). The additions directly correspond to the four commands given above.
\begintt
MailBox = MDIR username password (datastream | NAK | NPR).
SendMail = RML username password (ACK datastream | NAK | NPR).
ReceiveMail = SML username password msgno (datastream | NAK | NPR).
DeleteMail = DML username password msgno (ACK | NAK | NPR).
\endtt

\noindent  The message number is taken from the selected line in the mailbox viewer. The data transmitted are taken as (unformatted) texts. This is in contrast to file transfers, where they are taken as any sequence of bytes. The four command procedures listed below belong in module \code{Net}; they are listed together with the auxiliary procedures \code{SendText} and \code{ReceiveText} which closely correspond to \code{SendData} and \code{ReceiveData} (see Sect. 10.4).

We now turn our attention to the command procedures' counterparts in module \code{NetServer} listed in this Section. In order to explain these routines, a description of their interface with the mail server and a definition of the structure of mailboxes must precede. We begin with the simplest case, the counterpart of \code{SendMail}. It is the part of procedure \code{NetServer.Serve} which is guarded by the condition \code{typ = RML}, indicating a request to receive mail. As in all other services, the parameters username and password are read and the admissibility of the request is checked. The check is performed by procedure \code{Core.UserNo} which yields a negative number if service is to be refused. In the affirmative case, procedure \code{ReceiveData} obtains the message and stores it on a file, which is thereafter inserted into the mail queue as a task to be handled by the mail server at a later time. This may involve distribution of the message into several mailboxes.

Module \code{Core} is listed in Sect. 11.5. As mentioned before, it serves as link between the various server modules, defining the data types of the linking queues and also of mailboxes. Task queues are represented as \acro{FIFO}-lists. The descriptor of type \code{Queue} contains a pointer to the first list element used for retrieval, and a pointer to the last element used for insertion (see Fig. 11.3). These pointers are not exported; instead, the next task is obtained by calling procedure \code{Core.GetTask}, and it is deleted by \code{Core.RemoveTask}. There exist two exported variables of type \code{Queue}: \code{MailQueue} consumed by \code{MailServer}, and \code{PrintQueue} consumed by \code{PrintServer} (see Sect. 11.3.). (In fact, we use a third queue: \code{LineQueue} consumed by \code{LineServer}). Elements of queues are of type \code{TaskDesc} which specifies the file representing the data to be consumed. Additionally, it specifies the user number and identification of the task's originator. Three procedures are provided by module \code{Core} for handling task queues:
\begintt
PROCEDURE InsertTask(VAR q: Queue; F: Files.File; VAR id: ARRAY OF CHAR; uno: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE GetTask(VAR q: Queue; VAR F: Files.File; VAR id: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR uno: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE RemoveTask(VAR q: Queue);
\endtt

\noindent The server's counterparts of the remaining mail commands access mailboxes directly. The simplicity of the required actions---a result of a carefully chosen mailbox representation---and considerations of efficiency do not warrant a detour via task queue and mail server.

TODO: Fig
% \figure{pdfs/fig-11.3.png}{4.3in}{11.3}{Structure of task queue}

Every mailbox is represented as a file. This solution has the tremendous advantage that no special administration has to be introduced to handle a reserved partition of disk store for mail purposes. A mailbox file is partitioned into three parts: the block reservation part, the directory part, and the message part. Each part is quickly locatable, because the first two have a fixed length ($32 and 31 \times 32 = 992 bytes$). The message part is regarded as a sequence of blocks (of 256 bytes), and each message occupies an integral number of adjacent blocks. Corresponding to each block, the block reservation part contains a single bit indicating whether or not the block is occupied by a message. Since the block reservation part is 32 bytes long, the message part contains at most 256 blocks, i.e. 64K bytes. The block length was chosen after an analysis of messages which revealed that the average message is less than 500 bytes long.

The directory part consists of an array of 31 elements of type \code{MailEntry}, a record with the following fields: \code{pos} and \code{len} indicate the index of the message's first block and the message's number of bytes; \code{time} and \code{date} indicate the message's time of insertion, and originator indicates the message's source. The entries are linked (field \code{next}) in chronological order of their arrival, and entry 0 serves as the list's header. It follows that a mailbox contains at most 30 messages. An example of a mailbox state is shown in Fig. 11.4.
\begintt
MailEntry =
MResTab = MailDir =
RECORD
pos, next: INTEGER;
len: LONGINT;
time, date: INTEGER; originator: ARRAY 20 OF CHAR
END ;
ARRAY 8 OF SET; ARRAY 31 OF MailEntry;
\endtt

\noindent We are now in a position to inspect the handler for requests for message retrieval. It is guarded by the condition \code{typ = SML}. After a validity check, the respective requestor's mailbox file is opened. The last mailbox opened is retained by the global variable \code{MF} which acts as a single entry cache. The associated user number is given by the global variable \code{mailuno}. Since typically several requests involving the same mailbox follow, this measure avoids the repeated reopening of the same file. Thereafter, a rider is directly positioned at the respective directory entry for reading the message's length and position in the message part. The rider is repositioned accordingly, and transmission of the message is handled by procedure \code{SendMail}.

TODO: fig
%\figure{pdfs/fig-11.4.png}{4.3in}{11.4}{State of mailbox file}

Requests for the mailbox directory are handled by the routine guarded by the condition \code{typ = MDIR}. The directory part must be read and converted into a text. This task is supported by various auxiliary procedures (\code{Append}) which concatenate supplied data in a buffer for latter transmission. We emphasize that this request does not require the reading of any other part of the file, and therefore is very swift.

The last of the four mail service requests (\code{DML}) deletes a specified message. Removal from the directory requires a relinking of the entries. Unused entries are marked by their \code{len} field having value 0. Also, the blocks occupied by the message become free. The block reservation part must be updated accordingly.

In passing we note that the use of files for representing mailboxes, in combination with the file distribution services residing on the same server station, allows anyone to access (and inspect) any mailbox. Although we do not claim that this system provides secure protection against snooping, a minimal effort for protection was undertaken by a simple encoding of messages in mailbox files. This encoding is not shown in the program listings contained in this book.

One operation remains to be explained in more detail: the processing of tasks inserted into the mail queue. It consists of the insertion of the message represented by the task's file into one or several mailboxes. It involves the interpretation of the message's header, i.e. lines containing addresses, and the construction of a new header containing the name of the originator and the date of insertion into the mailbox. These actions are performed by procedures in module \code{MailServer}. Its procedure \code{Serve} is installed as an Oberon Task, and it is guarded by the condition \code{Core.MailQueue.n > 0}, indicating that at least one message needs to be dispatched.

The originator's name is obtained from \code{Core.GetUserName(uno)}, where uno is the user number obtained from the queue entry. The actual time is obtained from \code{Oberon.GetClock}. The form of the new header is shown by the following example:
\begintt
From: Gutknecht
At: 12.08.91 09:34:15
\endtt

\noindent The received message's header is then searched for recipients. Their names are listed in header lines starting with ``\code{To}'' (or ``\code{cc}''). After a name has been read, the corresponding user number is obtained by calling \code{Core.UserNum}. Then the message is inserted into the designated mailbox by procedure \code{Dispatch}. The search for recipients continues, until a line is encountered that does not begin with ``\code{To}'' (or ``\code{cc}''). A negative user number indicates that the given name is not registered. In this case, the message is returned to the sender, i.e. inserted into the mailbox of the sender. An exception is the recipient ``all'' which indicates a broadcast to all registered users.

Procedure \code{Dispatch} first opens the mailbox file of the user specified by the recipient number \code{rno}. If a mailbox exists, its block reservation part (\code{mrtab}) and its directory part (mdir) are read. Otherwise a new, empty box is created. Then follows the search for a free slot in the directory and, if found, the search for a sufficient number of free, adjacent blocks in the message part. The number of required blocks is given by the message length. If either no free slot exists, or there is no large enough free space for the message part, the message is returned to the sender (identified by \code{sno}). If also this attempt fails, the message is redirected to the postmaster (with user number 0). The postmaster is expected to inspect his mailbox sufficiently often so that no overflow occurs. If the postmaster's mailbox also overflows, the message is lost.

Only if all conditions for a successful completion are satisfied, is insertion begun. It starts with the marking of blocks in the reservation table and with the insertion of the new directory information. Table and directory are then updated on the file. Thereafter, the message with the constructed new header is written into the message part.

Perhaps it may seem to the reader that the addition of a separate module \code{MailServer}, together with a new Oberon \code{Task} and the machinery of the mail queue is not warranted by the relative simplicity of the insertion operation, and that it could have been incorporated into module \code{NetServer} just as well as message extraction. The picture changes, however, if handling of external mail is to be added, and if access to mailboxes via other channels, such as the \acro{RS}-232 line, is to be provided. The presented solution is based on a modular structure that facilitates such extensions without change of existing parts. External mail routines inevitably have to cope with message formats imposed by standards. Format transformations, encoding before sending to an external server and decoding before dispatching become necessary. Indeed, these operations have inflated module \code{MailServer} in a surprising degree. And lastly, the queuing machinery supports the easy insertion of additional message sources and provides a welcome decoupling and relaxation of timing constraints, particularly in the case of low-speed transmission media such as telephone lines.

\beginsubsection 11.3. PRINTING SERVICE.

TODO: Where the hell is this text?

\beginsubsection 11.4. MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES.

There exist a few additional services that are quite desirable under the presence of a central facility, and at the same time easy to include. They are briefly described in this section.

The set of commands of the file distribution service is augmented by \code{Net.DeleteFiles} and \code{Net.Directory}, allowing the remote deletion of files and inspection of the server's directory. The command procedures are listed below and must be regarded as part of module \code{Net} (Sect. 10.4). They communicate with their counterparts in module \code{NetServer} (Sect. 11.2.) according to the following protocol:
\begintt
DeleteFile = DEL username password filename (ACK | NAK | NPR).
Directory = FDIR username password prefix (datastream | NAK | NPR).
\endtt

\noindent The directory request carries a prefix; it uses procedure \code{FileDir.Enumerate} to obtain all file names starting with the specified prefix. Thereby the search can be limited to the relevant section of the directory.

Since requests to the server are always guarded by a password, a facility is necessary to set and change the password stored by the server. The respective command is \code{Net.SetPassword}, and its handler in the server is guarded by the condition \code{typ = NPW}. The corresponding protocol is
\begintt
NewPassword = NPW username oldpassword
(ACK DAT newpassword (ACK | NAK) | NAK | NPR).
\endtt

\noindent Finally, procedure \code{Net.GetTime} allows the workstation's real time clock to be adjusted to that of the central server. The protocol is
\begintt
GetTime = TRQ TIM time date.
\endtt

\noindent In concluding we summarize the entire protocol specification below. The combined server facility, comprising file distribution, electronic mail, printing, and time services is operating on a Ceres-1 computer (1 Mips) with a 2 MByte store, of which half is used by the printer's bitmap.

Summary of Protocol:
\begintt

ReceiveFile = datastream = SendFile = datastream = DeleteFile = Directory = MailBox = SendMail = ReceiveMail = DeleteMail = PrintStream = SendMsg = NameRequest = NewPassword =
GetTime =

MSG message ACK.
NRQ partnername [NRS].
NPW username oldpassword
(ACK DAT newpassword (ACK | NAK) | NAK | NPR).
TRQ TIM time date.
\endtt

\beginsubsection 11.5. USER ADMINISTRATION.

It appears to be a universal law that centralization inevitably calls for an administration. The centralized mail and printing services make no exception. The typical duties of an administration are accounting and protection against misuse. It has to ensure that rendered services are counted and that no unauthorized user is taking advantage of the server. An additional duty is often the gathering of statistical data. In our case, accounting plays a very minor role, and the reason for the existence of the administration presented here is primarily protection.

We distinguish between two kinds of protection. The first is protection of the server's resources in general, the second is that of individual users' resources from being accessed by others. Whereas in the first case some validation of a user's identification might suffice, the second case requires the association of personal resources with user names. In any case, the central server must store data for each member of the set of registered users. Specifically, it must be able to check the admissibility of a user's request on the basis of stored information.

Evidently, a protection administration is similar in purpose and function to a lock. Quite regularly, locks are subjected to attempts of breaking them, and locksmiths are subjected to attempts of being outwitted. The race between techniques of breaking locks and that of better countermeasures is well known, and we do not even try to make a contribution to it. Our design is based on the premise that the Oberon Server operates in a harmonious environment. Nevertheless, a minimal amount of protection machinery was included. It raises the amount of effort required for breaking protection to a level which is not reached when curiosity alone is the motivation.

The data about users is held in a table in module \code{Core}. As was mentioned earlier, \code{Core} acts as connector between the various servers by means of task queues. Its second purpose is to provide the necessary access to user data via appropriate procedures.

In the simplest solution, each table entry would contain a user name only. For each request, the administration would merely test for the presence of the request's user name in the table. A significant step towards safe protection is the introduction of a password in addition to the user name. In order that a request be honoured, not only must the name be registered, but the delivered and the stored password must match. Evidently, abusive attempts would aim at recovering the stored passwords. Our solution lies in storing an encoded password. The command \code{System.SetUser}, which asks for a user identification and a password, immediately encodes the password, and the original is stored nowhere. The encoding algorithm is such that it is difficult to construct a corresponding decoder.

The mail service requires a third attribute in addition to identification and encoded password: the user's name as it is used for addressing messages. Identification typically consists of the user's initials; for the name we suggest the full last name of the user and discourage cryptic abbreviations.

The printing service makes an accounting facility desirable. A fourth field in each user table entry serves as a count for the number of printed pages. As a result, there are four fields: \code{id}, \code{name}, \code{password}, and \code{count}. The table is not exported, but only accessible via procedures. \code{Core} is a good example of a resource hiding module. The program is listed below, and a few additional comments follow here.

Procedures \code{UserNo(id)} and \code{UserNum(name)} yield the table index of the identified user; it is called user number and is used as a short encoding for recipients and senders within the mail server. In other servers, the number is merely used to check a request's validity.

The user information must certainly survive any intermission of server operation, be it due to software, hardware, or power failure. This requires that a copy of the user information is held on backup store (disk). The simplest solution would be to use a file for this purpose. But this would indeed make protection too vulnerable: files can be accessed easily, and we have refrained from introducing a file protection facility. Instead, the backup of the user information is held on a few permanently reserved sectors on the server machine, which are inaccessible to the file system.

Apart from procedures and variables constituting the queuing mechanism for tasks, the procedures exported from module \code{Core} all belong to the administration, and they can be divided into two categories. The first category contains the procedures used by the three servers presented in this Chapter, and they are \code{UserNo}, \code{UserNum}, \code{IncPageCount}, \code{SetPassword}, \code{GetUserName} and \code{GetFileName}. The second category consists of the procedures \code{NofUsers} and \code{GetUser} for inspecting table entries, and \code{InsertUser}, \code{DeleteUser}, \code{ClearPassword}, \code{ClearCounts}, and \code{Init} for making changes to the table.

The client of the latter category is a module \code{Users} which is needed by the human administrator of the server facility.

The reader may at this point wonder why a more advanced concept of administration has not been chosen, which would allow the human administrator to operate the server remotely. A quick analysis of the consequences of this widely used approach reveals that a substantial amount of additions to our system would be required. The issue of security and protection would become inflated into dimensions that are hardly justified for our local system. The first consequence would be a differentiation among levels of protection. The administrator would become a so-called super-user with extra privileges, such as changing the user table. And so the game of trying to break the protection measures starts to become an interesting challenge.

We have resisted the temptation to introduce additional complexity. Instead, we assume that physical access to the server station is reserved to the administrator. Naturally, module \code{Users} and in particular the symbol file of \code{Core} do not belong to the public domain. In concluding, we may point out that the impossibility of activating users' programs on the server station significantly reduces the possibilities for inflicting damage from the exterior.

\beginchapter CHAPTER 12: THE COMPILER.

\beginsubsection 12.1. INTRODUCTION.

The compiler is the primary tool of the system builder. It therefore plays a prominent role in the Oberon System, although it is not part of the basic system. Instead, it constitutes a tool module---an application---with a single command: \code{Compile}. It translates program texts into machine code. Therefore, it is as a program inherently machine-dependent; it acts as the interface between source language and target computer.

In order to understand the process of compilation, the reader needs to be familiar with the source language Oberon defined in Appendix 1, and with the target computer RISC, defined in Appendix 2.

The language is defined as an infinite set of sequences of symbols taken from the language's vocabulary. It is described by a set of equations called syntax. Each equation defines a syntactic construct, or more precisely, the set of sequences of symbols belonging to that construct. It specifies how that construct is composed of other syntactic constructs. The meaning of programs is defined in terms of semantic rules governing each such construct.

Compilation of a program text proceeds by analyzing the text and thereby decomposing it recursively into its constructs according to the syntax. When a construct is identified, code is generated according to the semantic rule associated with the construct. The components of the identified construct supply parameters for the generated code.

It follows that we distinguish between two kinds of actions: analyzing steps and code generating steps. In a rough approximation we may say that the former are source language dependent and target computer independent, whereas the latter are source language independent and target computer dependent. Although reality is somewhat more complex, the module structure of this compiler clearly reflects this division. The main module of the compiler is \code{ORP} (for Oberon to \RISC Parser) It is primarily dedicated to syntactic analysis, parsing. Upon recognition of a syntactic construct, an appropriate procedure is called the code generator module \code{ORG} (for Oberon to \RISC Generator). Apart from parsing, \code{ORP} checks for type consistency of operands, and it computes the attributes of objects identified in declarations.

Whereas \code{ORP} mirrors the source language and is independent of a target computer, \code{ORG} reflects the target computer, but is independent of the source language.

Oberon program texts are regarded as sequences of symbols rather than sequences of characters. Symbols themselves, however, are sequences of characters. We refrain from explaining the reasons for this distinction, but mention that apart from special characters and pairs such as \code{+}, \code{\&}, \code{<=}, also identifiers, numbers, and strings are classified as symbols. Furthermore, certain capital letter sequences are symbols, such as \code{IF}, \code{END}, etc. Each time the syntax analyzer (parser) proceeds to read the next symbol, it does this by calling procedure \code{Get}, which constitutes the so-called scanner residing in module \code{ORS} (for Oberon to \RISC Scanner). It reads from the source text as many characters as are needed to recognize the next symbol.

In passing we note that the scanner alone reflects the definition of symbols in terms of characters, whereas the parser is based on the notion of symbols only. The scanner implements the abstraction of symbols. The recognition of symbols within a character sequence is called lexical analysis.

Ideally the recognition of any syntactic construct, say $A$, consisting of subconstructs, say $B_1, B_2, ... , B_n$, leads to the generation of code that depends only on (1) the semantic rules associated with $A$, and (2) on (attributes of) $B_1, B_2, ... , B_n$. If this condition is satisfied, the construct is said to be context-free, and if all constructs of a language are context-free, then also the language is context-free. Syntax and semantics of Oberon adhere to this rule, although with a significant exception. This exception is embodied by the notion of declarations. The declaration of an identifier, say \code{x}, attaches permanent properties to \code{x}, such as the fact that \code{x} denotes a variable and that its type is \code{T}. These properties are ``invisible'' when parsing a statement containing \code{x}, because the declaration of \code{x} is not also part of the statement. The ``meaning'' of identifiers is thus inherently context-dependent.

Context-dependence due to declarations is the immediate reason for the use of a global data structure which represents the declared identifiers and their properties (attributes). Since this concept stems from early assemblers where identifiers (then called symbols) were registered in a linear table, the term symbol table tends to persist for this structure, although in this compiler it is considerably more complex than an array. Basically, it grows during the processing of declarations, and it is searched while expressions and statements are processed. Procedures for building and for searching are contained in module \code{ORB}. % TODO: add reference to Knuth's attribute grammars here

A complication arises from the notion of exports and imports in Oberon. Its consequence is that the declaration of an identifier \code{x} may be in a module, say \code{M}, different from where \code{x} is referenced. If \code{x} is exported, the compiler includes \code{x} together with its attributes in the symbol file of the compiled module \code{M}. When compiling another module which imports \code{M}, that symbol file is read and its data are incorporated into the symbol table. Procedures for reading and writing symbol files are contained in module \code{ORB}, and no other module relies on information about the structure of symbol files.

The syntax is precisely and rigorously defined by a small set of syntactic equations. As a result, the parser is a reasonably perspicuous and short program. In spite of the high degree of regularity of the target computer, the process of code generation is more complicated, as shown by module \code{ORG}.

The resulting module structure of the compiler is shown in Fig. 12.1 in a slightly simplified manner. In reality \code{OCS} is imported by all other modules due to their need for procedure \code{OCS.Mark}. This, however, will be explained later.

\beginsubsection 12.2. CODE PATTERNS.

Before it is possible to understand how code is generated, one needs to know which code is generated. In other words, we need to know the goal before we find the way leading to the goal. A fairly concise description of this goal is possible due to the structure of the language. As explained before, semantics are attached to each individual syntactic construct, independent of its context. Therefore, it suffices to list the expected code---instead of an abstract semantic rule---for each syntactic construct.

As a prerequisite to understanding the resulting instructions and in particular their parameters, we need to know where declared variables are stored, i.e. which are their addresses. This compiler uses the straight-forward scheme of sequential allocation of consecutively declared variables. An address is a pair consisting of a base address (in a register) and an offset. Global variables are allocated in the module's data section and the respective base address register is \code{SB} (Static Base, see Chapter 6). Local variables are allocated in a procedure activation record on the stack; the respective base register is \code{SP} (Stack Pointer). Offsets are positive integers.

The amount of storage needed for a variable (called its size) is determined by the variable's type. The sizes of basic types are prescribed by the target computer's data representation. The following holds for the \RISC processor:
\medskip
\halign{#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\quad&#\hfil\cr
Type & Number of bytes\cr
\noalign{\smallskip\hrule}\cr
\code{BYTE}, \code{CHAR}, \code{BOOLEAN} & 1 \cr
\code{INTEGER}, \code{REAL}, \code{SET}, \code{POINTER}, \code{PROCEDURE} & 4 \cr
}\medskip
\noindent The size of an array is the size of the element type multiplied by the number of elements. The size of a record is the sum of the sizes of its fields.

A complication arises due to so-called alignment. By alignment is meant the adjustment of an address to a multiple of the variable's size. Alignment is performed for variable addresses as well as for record field offsets. The motivation for alignment is the avoidance of double memory references for variables being ``distributed'' over two adjacent words. Proper alignment enhances processing speed quite significantly. Variable allocation using alignment is shown by the example in Fig. 12.2.
\begintt
VAR b0: BYTE; int0: INTEGER; b1: BYTE; int1: INTEGER;
\endtt

\figure{pdfs/fig-12.2.png}{3.0in}{12.2}{Alignment of variables}

\noindent We note in passing that a reordering of the four variables lessens the number of unused bytes, as shown in Fig. 12.3.
\begintt
VAR int0, int1: INTEGER; b0, b1: BYTE;
\endtt

\figure{pdfs/fig-12.3.png}{1.3in}{12.3}{Improved order of variables}

Memory instructions compute the address as the sum of a register (base) and an offset constant. Local variables use the stack pointer \code{SP} (\code{R14}) as base, global variables the static base \code{SB} (\code{R13}) Every module has its own \code{SB} value, and therefore access to global (and imported) variables requires two instructions, one for fetching the base value, and one for loading or storing data. If the compiler can determine, whether the correct base value has already been loaded into the \code{SB} register, the former instruction is omitted.

The first 7 sample patterns contain global variables only, and their base \code{SB} is assumed to hold the appropriate value. Parameters of branch instructions denote jump distances from the instruction's own location (\code{PC}-relative).

\pattern{1} \emph{Assignment of constants}. We begin with a simple example of assigning constants to variables. The variables used in this example are global; their base register is \code{SB}. Each assignment results in a single instruction. The constant is embedded within the instruction as a literal operand.

\endtt

\noindent \pattern{2} \emph{Simple expressions}: The result of an expression containing operators is always stored in a register before it is assigned to a variable or used in another operation.

Registers for intermediate results are allocated sequentially in ascending order $R_0, R_1, ... , R_{11}$. Integer multiplication and division by powers of 2 are represented by shifts (\code{LSL}, \code{ASR}). Similarly, the modulus by a power of 2 is obtained by masking off leading bits. The operations of set union, difference, and intersection are represented by logical operations (\code{OR}, \code{AND}).

\noindent \pattern{3} \emph{Indexed variables}: References to elements of arrays make use of the possibility to add an index value to an offset. The index must be present in a register and be multiplied by the size of the array elements. (For integers with size 4 this is done by a shift of 2 bits). Then this index is checked whether it lies within the bounds specified in the array's declaration. This is achieved by a comparison, actually a subtraction, and a subsequent branch instruction causing a trap, if the index is either negative or beyond the upper bound.

If the reference is to an element of a multi-dimensional array (matrix), its address computation involves several multiplications and additions. The address of an element $A[i_{k-1}, ... , i_1, i_0]$ of a $k$-dimensional array $A$ with lengths $n_{k-1}, ... , n_1, n_0$ is
$$adr(A)+((...((i_{k-1} *n_{k-2})+i_{k-2})*n_{k-3} +...)*n_1 +i_1)*n_0 +i_0$$
Note that for index checks \code{CMP} is written instead of \code{SUB} to mark that the subtraction is merely a comparison, that the result remains unused and only the condition flag registers hold the result.

\noindent \pattern{5} \emph{Boolean expressions, If statements}: Conditional statements imply that parts of them are skipped. This is done by the use of branch instructions whose operand specifies the distance of the branch. The instructions refer to the condition-register as an implicit operand. Its value is determined by a preceding instruction, typically a compare or a bit-test instruction.

The Boolean operators \code{\&} and \code{OR} are purposely not defined as total functions, but rather by the equations % TODO: add definition of total function
\begintt
  p & q  = if p then q else FALSE
  p OR q = if p then TRUE else q
\endtt

\noindent Consequently, Boolean operators must be translated into branches too. Evidently, branches stemming from if statements and branches stemming from Boolean operators should be merged, if possible. The resulting code therefore does not necessarily mirror the structure of the \code{if} statement directly, as can be seen from the code in \code{Pattern5}. We must conclude that code generation for Boolean expressions differs in some aspects from that for arithmetic expressions.

The example of \code{Pattern5} is also used to exhibit the code resulting from the standard procedures \code{INC}, \code{DEC}, \code{INCL}, and \code{EXCL}. These procedures provide an opportunity to use shorter code in those cases where a single two-operand instruction suffices, i.e. when one of the arguments is identical with the destination.

\noindent \pattern{12} \emph{Imported variables and procedures:} When a procedure is imported from another module, its address is unavailable to the compiler. Instead, the procedure is identified by a number obtained from the imported module's \emph{symbol file}. In place of the offset, the branch instruction holds (1) the number of the imported module, (2) the number of the imported procedure, and (3) a link in the list of \code{BL} instructions calling an external procedure. This list is traversed by the linking loader, that computes the actual offset (fixup, see Chapter 6).

Imported variables are also referenced by a variable's number. In general, an access required two instructions. The first loads the static base register \code{SB} from a global table with the address of that module's data section. The module number of the imported variable serves as index. The second instruction loads the address of the variable, using the actual offset fixed up by the loader.

In the following example, modules \code{Pattern12a} and \code{Pattern12b} both export a procedure and a variable. They are referenced from the importing module \code{Pattern12c}.

MODULE Pattern12a;
  VAR k*: INTEGER;

\noindent \pattern{13} \emph{Record extensions with pointers:} Fields of a record type R1, which is declared as an extension of a type R0, are simply appended to the fields of R0, i.e. their offsets are greater than those of the fields of R0. When a record is statically declared, its type is known by the compiler. If the record is referenced via a pointer, however, this is not the case. A pointer bound to a base type R0 may well refer to a record of an extension R1 of R0. Type tests (and type guards) allow to test for the actual type. This requires that a type can be identified at the time of program execution. Because the language defines name equivalence instead of structural equivalence of types, a type may be identified by a number. We use the address of a unique type descriptor for this purpose.

Therefore, type tests consist of a simple address comparison which is very fast. Type descriptors are stored in the module's area for data. Their address is called \emph{type tag}. The tag of a (dynamically allocated) variable is stored as a prefix to its record (with offset -8).

A type descriptor contains---in addition to information stored for use by the garbage collector---a table of tags of all its base types. If, for instance, a type R2 is an extension of R1 which is an extension of R0, the descriptor of R2 contains the tags of R1 and R0 as shown in Fig. 12.4. The table has a fixed number of 3 entries.

A type test of the form \code{p IS T} then, consists of a comparison of the type tag of \code{p^} at address \code{p-8} with the tag held in the descriptor of \code{T} at the extension level of the type of \code{p^}. A type guard \code{p(T)} is synonymous to the statement

\noindent \pattern{14} \emph{Record extensions as \code{VAR} parameters:} Records occurring as \code{VAR}-parameters may also require a type test at program execution time. This is because \code{VAR}-parameters effectively constitute hidden pointers. Type tests and type guards on \code{VAR}-parameters are handled in the same way as for variables referenced via pointers, with a slight difference, however. Statically declared record variables may be used as actual parameters, and they are not prefixed by a type tag. Therefore, the tag has to be supplied together with the variable's address when the procedure is called, i.e. when the actual parameter is established. Record structured \code{VAR}-parameters therefore consist of address and type tag. This is similar to dynamic array descriptors consisting of address and length.

\beginsubsection 12.3. INTERNAL DATA STRUCTURES AND MODULE INTERFACES.

\beginsubsubsection 12.3.1. Data structures.

In Section 12.1 it was explained that declarations inherently constitute context-dependence of the translation process. Although parsing still proceeds on the basis of a context-free syntax and relies on contextual information only in a few isolated instances, information provided by declarations affects the generated code significantly. During the processing of declarations, their information is transferred into the ``symbol table'', a data structure of considerable complexity, from where it is retrieved for the generation of code.

This dynamic data structure is defined in module \code{ORB} in terms of two record types called \code{Object} and \code{Struct}. These types pervade all other modules with the exception of the scanner. They are therefore explained before further details of the compiler are discussed (see module \code{ORB} below).

For each declared identifier an instance of type \code{Object} is generated. The record holds the identifier and the properties associated with the identifier given in its declaration. Since Oberon is a \emph{statically typed} language, every object has a type. It is represented in the record by its \code{typ} field, which is a pointer to a record of type \code{Struct}. Since many objects may be of the same type, it is appropriate to record the type's attributes only once and to refer to them via a pointer. The properties of type \code{Struct} will be discussed below.

The kind of object which a table entry represents is indicated by the field class. Its values are denoted by declared integer constants: \code{Var} indicates that the entry describes a variable, \code{Con} a constant, \code{Fld} a record field, \code{Par} a \code{VAR}-parameter, and \code{Proc} a procedure. Different kinds of entries carry different attributes. A variable or a parameter carries an address, a constant has a value, a record field has an offset, and a procedure has an entry address, a list of parameters, and a result type. For each class the introduction of an extended record type would seem advisable. This was not done, however, for three reasons. First, the compiler was first formulated in (a subset of) Modula-2 which does not feature type extension. Second, not making use of type extensions would make it simpler to translate the compiler into other languages for porting the language to other computers. And third, all extensions were known at the time the compiler was planned. Hence extensibility provided no argument for the introduction of a considerable variety of types. The simplest solution lies in using the multi-purpose fields \code{val} and \code{dsc} for class-specific attributes. For example, \code{val} holds an address for variables, parameters, and procedures, an offset for record fields, and a value for constants.

The definition of a type yields a record of type \code{Struct}, regardless of whether it occurs within a type declaration, in which case also a record of type \code{Object} (\code{class} = \code{Typ}) is generated, or in a variable declaration, in which case the type remains anonymous. All types are characterized by a form and a size. A type is either a basic type or a constructed type. In the latter case it refers to one or more other types. Constructed types are arrays, records, pointers, and procedural types. The attribute \code{form} refers to this classification. Its value is an integer.

Just as different object classes are characterized by different attributes, different forms have different attributes. Again, the introduction of extensions of type \code{Struct} was avoided. Instead, some of the fields of type \code{Struct} remain unused in some cases, such as for basic types, and others are used for form-specific attributes. For example, the attribute \code{base} refers to the element type in the case of an array, to the result type in the case of a procedural type, to the type to which a pointer is bound, or to the base type of a (extended) record type. The attribute \code{dsc} refers to the parameter list in the case of a procedural type, or to the list of fields in the case of a record type.

As an example, consider the following declarations. The corresponding data structure is shown in Fig. 12.5. For details, the reader is referred to the program listing of module \code{ORB} and the respective explanations.
\begintt
CONST N = 100;
TYPE Ptr = POINTER TO Rec;
     Rec = RECORD n: INTEGER; p, q: Ptr END ;
VAR k: INTEGER;
    a: ARRAY N OF INTEGER;
PROCEDURE P(x: INTEGER): INTEGER;
\endtt

\figure{pdfs/fig-12.5.png}{4.7in}{12.5}{Representation of declarations}

Only entries representing constructed types are generated during compilation. An entry for each basic type is established by the compiler's initialization. It consists of an \code{Object} holding the standard type's identifier and a \code{Struct} indicating its form, denoted by one of the values \code{Byte}, \code{Bool}, \code{Char}, \code{Int}, \code{Real}, or \code{Set}. The object records of the basic types are anchored in global pointer variables in module \code{ORB} (which actually should be regarded as constants).

Not only are entries created upon initialization for basic types, but also for all standard procedures. Therefore, every compilation starts out with a symbol table reflecting all standard, pervasive identifiers and the objects they stand for.

We now return to the subject of Objects. Whereas objects of basic classes (\code{Const}, \code{Var}, \code{Par}, \code{Fld}, \code{Typ}, \code{SProc}, \code{SFunc} and \code{Mod}) directly reflect declared identifiers and constitute the context in which statements and expressions are compiled, compilations of expressions typically generate anonymous entities of additional, non-basic modes. Such entities reflect selectors, factors, terms, etc., i.e. constituents of expressions and statements. As such, they are of a transitory nature and hence are not represented by records allocated on the heap. Instead, they are represented by record variables local to the processing procedures and are therefore allocated on the stack. Their type is called \code{Item} and is a slight variation of the type \code{Object}. Items are not referenced via pointers.

Let us assume, for instance, that a term \code{x*y} is parsed. This implies that the operator and both factors have been parsed already. The factors \code{x} and \code{y} are represented by two variables of type \code{Item} of \code{Var} mode. The resulting term is again described by an \code{Item}, and since the product is transitory, i.e. has significance only within the expression of which the term is a constituent, it is to be held in a temporary location, in a register. In order to express that an item is located in a register, a new, non-basic mode \code{Reg} is introduced.

Effectively, all non-basic modes reflect the target computer's architecture, in particular its addressing modes. The more addressing modes a computer offers, the more item modes are needed to represent them. The additional item modes required by the \RISC processor are. They are declared in module \code{ORG}:
\medskip
\item{\code{Reg}:}  direct register mode
\item{\code{RegI}:} indirect register mode
\item{\code{Cond}:} condition code mode
\medskip
The use of the types \code{Object}, \code{Item}, and \code{Struct} for the various modes and forms, and the meaning of their attributes are explained in the following tables:
\medskip

\code{SFunc} &  7 &  inline code number \cr
\code{Mod}   &  8 &  key \cr
}\medskip
{\bf{\tt TODO:} Add the rest of the values}

Items have an attribute called \code{lev} which is part of the address of the item. Positive values denote the level of nesting of the procedure in which the item is declared; \code{lev} = 0 implies a global object. Negative values indicate that the object is imported from the module with number -\code{lev}.

The three types \code{Object}, \code{Item}, and \code{Struct} are defined in module \code{ORB}, which also contains procedures for accessing the symbol table.

\beginsubsubsection 12.3.2. Module interfaces.

Before embarking on a presentation of the compiler's main module, the parser, an overview of its remaining modules is given in the form of their interfaces. The reader is invited to refer to them when studying the parser.

The interface of the scanner module \code{ORS} is simple. It defines the numeric values of all symbols. But its chief constituent is procedure \code{Get}. Each call yields the next symbol from the source text, identified by an integer. Global variables represent attributes of the read symbol in certain cases. If a number was read, \code{ival} or \code{rval} hold its numeric value. If an identifier or a string was read, \code{str} holds the \ASCII values of the characters read.

Procedure \code{Mark} serves to generate a diagnostic output indicating a brief diagnostic and the scanner's current position in the source text. This procedure is located in the scanner, because only the scanner has access to its current position. \code{Mark} is called from all other modules.
\begintt
DEFINITION ORS; (*Scanner*)
  IMPORT Texts, Oberon;
  TYPE Ident = ARRAY 32 OF CHAR;
  VAR ival, slen: INTEGER;
      rval: REAL;
      id: Ident;

      errcnt: BOOLEAN;
  PROCEDURE Mark (msg: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  PROCEDURE Get (VAR sym: INTEGER);
  PROCEDURE Init (source: Texts.Text; pos: INTEGER);
END ORS.
\endtt

\noindent Module \code{ORB} defines the basic data structures representing declared objects and their types. It also contains procedures for accessing these structures. \code{NewObj} serves to insert a new identifier, and it returns a pointer to the allocated object. \code{ThisObj} returns the pointer to the object whose name equals the global scanner variable \code{ORS.id}. \code{thisimport} and \code{thisfield} deliver imported objects and record fields with names equal to \code{ORS.id}.

Procedure \code{Import} serves to read the specified symbol file and to enter its identifier in the symbol table (\code{class} = \code{Mod}). Finally, \code{Export} generates the symbol file of the compiled module, containing descriptions of all objects and structures marked for export.

END ORB.
\endtt

\noindent Module \code{ORG} contains the procedures for code generation. The names of these procedures indicate the respective constructs for which code is to be produced. Note that an individual code generator procedure is provided for every standard, predefined procedure. This is necessary, because they generate in-line code.

\beginsubsection 12.4. THE PARSER.

The main module \code{ORP} constitutes the parser. Its single command \code{Compile}---at the end of the program listing---identifies the source text according to the Oberon command conventions. It then calls procedure \code{Module} with the identified source text as parameter. The command forms are:

\item{} \code{ORP.Compile} The most recent selection identifies the beginning of the source text.
\item{} \code{@ ORP.Compile} The most recent selection identifies the name of the source file.
\item{} \code{^ ORP.Compile f0 f1 ... ~} \code{f0, f1, ...} are the names of source files.

\noindent File names and the characters \code{@} and \code{^} may be followed by an option specification \code{/s}. Option \code{s} enables the compiler to overwrite an existing symbol file, thereby invalidating clients.

The parser is designed according to the proven method of top-down, recursive descent parsing with a look-ahead of a single symbol. The last symbol read is represented by the global variable \code{sym}. Syntactic entities are mirrored by procedures of the same name. Their goal is to recognize the specified construct in the source text. The start symbol and corresponding procedure is \code{Module}. The principal parser procedures are shown in Fig.~12.6., which also exhibits their calling hierarchy. Loops in the diagram indicate recursion in the syntactic definition.

\figure{pdfs/fig-12.6.png}{4.7in}{12.6}{Parser procedure hierarchy}

The rule of parsing strictly based on a single-symbol look-ahead and without reference to context is violated in three places. The prominent violation occurs in statements. If the first symbol of a statement is an identifier, the decision of whether an assignment or a procedure call is to be recognized is based on contextual information, namely the class of the identified object. The second violation occurs in qualident; if the identifier \code{x} preceding a period denotes a module, it is recognized together with the subsequent identifier as a qualified identifier. Otherwise \code{x} supposedly denotes a record variable. The third violation is made in procedure selector; if an identifier is followed by a left parenthesis, the decision of whether a procedure call or a type guard is to be recognized is again made on the basis of contextual information, namely the mode of the identified object.

A fairly large part of the program is devoted to the discovery of errors. Not only should they be properly diagnosed. A much more difficult requirement is that the parsing process should continue on the basis of a good guess about the structure that the text should most likely have. The parsing process must continue with some assumption and possibly after skipping a short piece of the source text. Hence, this aspect of the parser is mostly based on heuristics. Incorrect assumptions about the nature of a syntactic error lead to secondary error diagnostics. There is no way to avoid them. A reasonably good result is obtained by the fact that procedure \code{ORS.Mark} inhibits an error report, if it lies less than 10 characters ahead of the last one. Also, the language Oberon is designed with the property that most large constructs begin with a unique symbol, such as \code{IF}, \code{WHILE}, \code{CASE}, \code{RECORD}, etc. These symbols facilitate the recovery of the parsing process in the erroneous text. More problematic are open constructs which neither begin nor end with key symbols, such as types, factors, and expressions. Relying on heuristics, the source text is skipped up to the first occurrence of a symbol which may begin a construct that follows the one being parsed. The employed scheme may not be the best possible, but it yields quite acceptable results and keeps the amount of program devoted to the handling of erroneous texts within justifiable bounds.

Besides the parsing of text, the Parser also performs the checking for type consistency of objects. This is based on type information held in the global table, gained during the processing of declarations, which is also handled by the routines which parse. Thereby an unjustifiably large number of very short procedures is avoided. However, the strict target-computer independence of the parser is violated slightly: Information about variable allocation strategy including alignment, and about the sizes of basic types is used in the parser module. Whereas the former violation is harmless, because the allocation strategy is hardly controversial, the latter case constitutes a genuine target-dependence embodied in a number of explicitly declared constants. Mostly these constants are contained in the respective type definitions, represented by records of type Type initialized by \code{ORB}. The following procedures allocate objects and generate elements of the symbol table:
\medskip
\item{Declarations} Object(Con), Object(Typ), Object(Var) 
\item{ProcedureDeclaration} Object(xProc)
\item{FormalType} Object(Var), Object(Par)
\item{ORB.Import} Object(Mod)
\item{RecordType} Object(Fld), Type(Record) 
\item{ArrayType} Type(Array) 
\item{ProcedureType} Type(ProcTyp) 
\item{Type} Type(Pointer) 
\item{FormalType} Type(Array)
\medskip

\noindent An inherently nasty subject is the treatment of forward references in a single-pass compiler. In Oberon, there are two such cases:

\item{1.} Forward declarations of procedures. They have been eliminated from the revision of the Oberon language in the year 2007 as they should be avoided if ever possible. If it is impossible, a remedy is to declare a variable of the given procedure type, and assign the procedure to be forwarded to this variable. The nastiness of procedure forward declarations originates in the necessity to specify parameters and result type in the forward declaration. These must be repeated in the actual procedure declaration, and one expects that a compiler verifies the equality (or equivalence) of the two declarations. This is a heavy burden for a case that very rarely occurs.

\item{2.} Forward declarations of pointer types also constitutes a nasty exception, but its exclusion would be difficult to justify. If in a pointer declaration the base type (to which the pointer is bound) is not found in the symbol table, a forward reference is therefore automatically assumed. An entry for the pointer type is generated anyway (see procedure \code{Type}) and an element is inserted in the list of pointer base types to be fixed up. This list is headed by the global variable pbsList. When later in the text a declaration of a record type is encountered with the same identifier, the forward entry is recognized and the proper link is established (see procedure \code{Declarations}).

\noindent The compiler must check for undefined forward references when the current declaration scope is closed. This check is performed at the end of procedure \code{Declarations}.

The with statement had been eliminated from the language in its revision of 2007. Here it reappears in the form of a case statement, whose cases are not labelled by integers, but rather by types. What formerly was written as
\begintt
IF x IS T1 THEN
  WITH x: T1 DO ... x ... END
ELSIF x IS T2 THEN
  WITH x: T2 DO ... x ... END
ELSIF ... END
\endtt
is now written more simply and more efficiently as
\begintt
CASE x OF
  T1: ... x ... |
  T2: ... x ... |
  ...
END
\endtt
where \code{T1} and \code{T2} are extensions of the type \code{T0} of the case variable \code{x}. Compilation of this form of \code{case} statement merges the regional type guard of the former \code{with} statements with the type test of the former \code{if} statements. This \code{case} statement represents the only case where a symbol table entry---the type of \code{x}---is modified during compilation of statements. When the end of the \code{with} statement is reached, the change must be reverted.

\beginsubsection 12.5. THE SCANNER.

The scanner module \code{ORS} embodies the lexicographic definitions of the language, i.e. the definition of abstract symbols in terms of characters. The scanner's substance is procedure \code{Get}, which scans the source text and, for each call, identifies the next symbol and yields the corresponding integer code. It is most important that this process be as efficient as possible. Procedure \code{Get} recognizes letters indicating the presence of an identifier (or reserved word), and digits signalling the presence of a number. Also, the scanner recognizes comments and skips them. The global variable \code{ch} stands for the last character read.

A sequence of letters and digits may either denote an identifier or a key word. In order to determine which is the case, a search is made in a table containing all key words for each would-be identifier. This table is sorted alphabetically and according to the length of reserved words. It is initialized when the compiler is loaded.

The presence of a digit signals a number. Procedure \code{Number} first scans the subsequent digits (and letters) and stores them in a buffer. This is necessary, because hexadecimal numbers are denoted by the postfix letter \code{H} (rather than a prefix character). The postfix letter \code{X} specifies that the digits denote a character.

There exists one case in the language Oberon, where a look-ahead of a single character does not suffice to identify the next symbol. When a sequence of digits is followed by a period, this period may either be the decimal point of a real number, or it may be the first element of a range symbol ( \code{..} ). Fortunately, the problem can be solved locally as follows: \code{If}, after reading digits and a period, a second period is present, the number symbol is returned, and the look-ahead variable ch is assigned the special value \code{7FX}. A subsequent call of \code{Get} then delivers the range symbol. Otherwise the period after the digit sequence belongs to the (real) number.

\beginsubsection 12.6. SEARCHING THE SYMBOL TABLE, AND HANDLING SYMBOL FILES.

\beginsubsubsection 12.6.1. The structure of the symbol table.

The symbol table constitutes the context in which statements and expressions are parsed. Each procedure establishes a scope of visibility of local identifiers. The records registering identifiers belonging to a scope are linked as a linear list. They are of type \code{Object}. Each object has a type.

Types are represented by records of type \code{Type}. These two types pervade the entire compiler, and they are defined as follows:
\begintt
TYPE Object = POINTER TO ObjDesc;
  Type = POINTER TO TypeDesc;
  ObjDesc = RECORD
    class, lev, exno: INTEGER;
    expo, rdo: BOOLEAN; next, dsc: Object; type: Type;
    name: ORS.Ident; val: INTEGER
  END ;
  (*exported / read-only*)
  TypeDesc = RECORD
    form, ref, mno: INTEGER; (*ref is only used for import/export*)
    nofpar: INTEGER; (*for procedures; extension level for records*)
    len: INTEGER; (*for arrays, len < 0 => open array; for records: adr of descriptor*)
    dsc, typobj: Object;
    base: Type; (*for arrays, records, pointers*)
    size: INTEGER; (*in bytes; always multiple of 4, except for Byte, Bool and Char*)
  END ;
\endtt

\noindent Procedures for generating and searching the lists are contained in module \code{ORB}. If a new identifier is to be added, procedure \code{NewObj} first searches the list, and if the identifier is already present, a double definition is diagnosed. Otherwise the new element is appended, thereby preserving the order given by the source text.

Procedures, and therefore also scopes, may be nested. Each scope is represented by the list of its declared identifiers, and the list of the currently visible scopes are again connected as a list. Procedure \code{OpenScope} appends an element and procedure \code{CloseScope} removes it. The list of scopes is anchored in the global variable topScope and linked by the field \code{dsc}. It is treated like a stack. It consists of elements of type \code{Object}, each one being the header (\code{class} = \code{Head}) of the list of declared entities. As an example, the procedure for searching an object (with name \code{ORS.id}) is shown here:
\begintt
PROCEDURE thisObj*(): Object;
  VAR s, x: Object;
BEGIN
  s := topScope;
  REPEAT x := s.next;
  WHILE (x # NIL) & (x.name # ORS.id)
  DO x := x.next END ;
  s := s.dsc
  UNTIL (x # NIL) OR (s = NIL); RETURN x
END thisObj;
\endtt
A snapshot of a symbol table for an example with nested scopes is shown in Fig. 12.6. It is taken
when the following declarations are parsed and when the statement S is reached.
\begintt
VAR x: INTEGER;
PROCEDURE P(u: INTEGER);
BEGIN ... END P;
PROCEDURE Q(v: INTEGER);
PROCEDURE R(w: INTEGER);
BEGIN S END R;
BEGIN ... END Q;
\endtt

\figure{pdfs/fig-12.7.png}{4.7in}{12.7}{Snapshot of a symbol table}

A search of an identifier proceeds first through the scope list, and for each header its list of object records is scanned. This mirrors the scope rule of the language and guarantees that if several entities carry the same identifier, the most local one is selected. The linear list of objects represents the simplest implementation by far. A tree structure would in many cases be more efficient for searching, and would therefore seem more recommendable. Experiments have shown, however, that the gain in speed is marginal. The reason is that the lists are typically quite short. The superiority of a tree structure becomes manifest only when a large number of global objects is declared. We emphasize that when a tree structure is used for each scope, the linear lists must still be present, because the order of declarations is sometimes relevant in interpretation, e.g. in parameter lists.

Not only procedures, but also record types establish their own local scope. The list of record fields is anchored in the type record's field \code{dsc}, and it is searched by procedure \code{thisField}. If a record type \code{R1} is an extension of \code{R0}, then \code{R1}'s field list contains only the fields of the extension proper. The base type \code{R0} is referenced by the \code{BaseTyp} field of \code{R1}. Hence, a search for a field may have to proceed through the field lists of an entire sequence of record base types.

\beginsubsubsection 12.6.2. Symbol files.

The major part of module \code{ORB} is devoted to input and output of symbol files. A symbol file is a linearized form of an excerpt of the symbol table containing descriptions of all exported (marked) objects. All exports are declared in the global scope. Procedure \code{Export} traverses the list of global objects and outputs them to the symbol file.

The structure of a symbol file is defined by the syntax specified below. The following terminal symbols are class and form specifiers or reference numbers for basic types with fixed values:
\begintt
Classes: Con=1,Var=2,Par=3,Fld=4;Typ=5
Forms: Byte=1,Bool=2,Char=3,Int=4,LInt=5,Set=6, Pointer = 7, NoTyp = 9, ProcTyp = 10, Array = 12, Record = 13
Syntax:
SymFile = null key name versionkey {object}.
object = (CON name type (value | exno) | TYP name type [{fix} 0] | VAR name type expno). type = ref (PTR type | ARR type len | REC type {field} 0 | PRO type {param} 0].
dsc
39
field = FLD name type offset. param = (VAR | PAR) type.
\endtt

\noindent A procedure type description is contains a parameter list. Similarly, a record type description with form specifier \code{Record} contains the list of field descriptions. Note that a procedure is considered as a constant of a procedure type.

Objects have types, and types are referenced by pointers. These cannot be written on a file. The straight-forward solution would be to use the type identifiers as they appear in the program to denote types. However, this would be rather crude and inefficient, and second, there are anonymous types, for which artificial identifiers would have to be generated.

An elegant solution lies in consecutively numbering types. Whenever a type is encountered the first time, it is assigned a unique reference number. For this purpose, records (in the compiler) of type Type contain the field ref. Following the number, a description of the type is then written to the symbol file. When the type is encountered again during the traversal of the data structure, only the reference number is issued, with negative sign. The global variable \code{ORB.Ref} functions as the running reference number.

When reading a symbol file, a positive reference number is followed by the type's description. A pointer to the type read is assigned to the global table \code{typtab} with the reference number as index. When a negative reference number is read (it is not followed by a type description), then the type is identified by \code{typtab[-ref]} (see procedure \code{InType}). In the following example, types are identified by their reference number (e.g. \code{R \#14}), and later referenced by this number (\code{^14}).
\begintt
MODULE A;
CONST Ten* = 10; Dollar* = "$";
TYPE R* = RECORD u*: INTEGER; v*: SET END ;
S* = RECORD w*: ARRAY 4 OF R END ; P* = POINTER TO R;
A* = ARRAY 8 OF INTEGER;
B* = ARRAY 4, 5 OF REAL;
C* = ARRAY 10 OF S;
D* = ARRAY OF CHAR;
VAR x*: INTEGER;
PROCEDURE Q0*;
BEGIN END Q0;
PROCEDURE Q1*(x, y: INTEGER): INTEGER; BEGIN RETURN x+y END Q1;
END A.
class = CON Ten [^4] 10
class = CON Dollar [^3] 36
class=TYPR[#14 form=REC[^9] exno=1 extlev=0 size=8{v[^6] 4u[^4] 0}]()
class=TYPS[#15 form=REC[^9] exno=2 extlev=0 size=32{w[#0 form=ARR[^14] len=4 size=32] 0}]() class = TYP P [#16 form = PTR [^14]]()
class=TYPA[#17 form=ARR[^4] len=8 size=32]()
class=TYPB[#18 form=ARR[#0 form=ARR[^5] len=5 size=20] len=4 size=80]()
class = TYP C [#19 form = ARR [^15] len = 10 size = 320]()
class=TYPD[#20 form=ARR[^3] len=-1 size=8]()
class = VAR x [^4] 3
class = CON Q0 [#0 form = PRO [^9]()] 4
class = CON Q1 [#0 form = PRO [^4]( class = VAR [^4] class = VAR [^4])] 5
\endtt
After a symbol file has been generated, it is compared with the file from a previous compilation of the same module, if one exists. Only if the two files differ and if the compiler's s-option is enabled, is the old file replaced by the new version. The comparison is made by comparing byte after byte without consideration of the file's structure. This somewhat crude approach was chosen because of its simplicity and yielded good results in practice.

A symbol file must not contain addresses (of variables or procedures). If they did, most changes in the program would result in a change of the symbol file. This must be avoided, because changes in the implementation (rather than the interface) of a module are supposed to remain invisible to the clients. Only changes in the interface are allowed to effect changes in the symbol file, requiring recompilation of all clients. Therefore, addresses are replaced by export numbers. The variable exno (global in ORP) serves as running number (see \code{ORP.Declarations} and \code{ORP.ProcedureDecl}). The translation from export number to address is performed by the loader. Every code file contains a list (table) of addresses (of variables and entry points for procedures). The export number serves as index in this table to obtain the requested address. Export numbers are generated by the parser.

Objects exported from some module M1 may refer in their declaration to some other module \code{M0} imported by \code{M1}. It would be unacceptable, if an import of \code{M1} would then also require the import of \code{M0}, i.e. imply the automatic reading of \code{M01}'s symbol file. It would trigger a chain reaction of imports that must be avoided. Fortunately, such a chain reaction can be avoided by making symbol files self-contained, i.e. by including in every symbol file the description of entities that stem from other modules. Such entities are always types.

The inclusion of types imported from other modules seems simple enough to handle: type descriptions must include a reference to the module from which the type was imported. This reference is the name and key of the respective module. However, there exists one additional complication that cannot be ignored. Consider a module \code{M1} importing a variable \code{x} from a module \code{M0}. Let the type \code{T} of x be defined in module \code{M0}. Also, assume \code{M1} to contain a variable \code{y} of type \code{M0.T}. Evidently, \code{x} and \code{y} are of the same type, and the compiler compiling \code{M2} must recognize this fact. Hence, when importing \code{M0} during compilation of \code{M1}, the imported element \code{T} must not only be registered in the symbol table, but it must also be recognized as being identical to the \code{T} already imported from \code{M2} directly. It is rather fortunate that the language definition specifies equivalence of types on the basis of names rather than structure, because it allows type tests at execution time to be implemented by a simple address comparison.

The measures to be taken to satisfy the new requirements are as follows:

\item{1.} Every type element in a symbol file is given a module number. Before a type description is emitted to the file.
\item{2.} If a type to be exported has a name and stems from another, imported module, then also the name and key of the module are attached, from which the type stems (see end of procedure \code{ORB.OutType} and end of \code{ORB.InType}).

An additional detail is worth being mentioned here: Hidden pointers. We recall that individual fields of exported record types may be hidden. If marked (by an asterisk) they are exported and therefore visible in importing modules. If not marked, they are not exported and remain invisible, and evidently seem to be omissible in symbol files. However, this is a fallacy. They need to be included in symbol files, although without name, because of meta information to be provided for garbage collection. This is elucidated as follows:

Assume that a module \code{M1} declares a global pointer variables of a type imported from module \code{M0}.
\begintt
MODULE M0;
TYPE Ptr = POINTER TO Rec0;
Rec0* = RECORD p*, q: Ptr ... END ; END M0.
MODULE M1; VAR p: M0.Ptr;
r: RECORD f: M0.Ptr; ... END ; END M1.
\endtt
Here \code{p} and \code{r.f} are roots of data structures that must be visited by the garbage collector. If they are not, they will not be marked, and therefore collected with disastrous and entirely unpredictable consequences. The crux is that not only exported pointers (\code{p.p}) must be listed, but also hidden ones (\code{p.q}), although they are not accessible in module \code{M1}.

We chose to include hidden pointers in symbol files without their names, but with their type being of the form \code{ORB.NilTyp}. This must be considered in procedure \code{ORG.FindPtrs}, where the condition \code{typ.form} = \code{ORB.Pointer} must be extended to (\code{typ.form} = \code{ORB.Pointer}) \lor\ (\code{typ.form} = \code{ORB.NilTyp}).

But the story does not end here. Assume that in the example above module \code{M1} declares a type \code{Rec1} as a \code{n} extension of \code{M0.Rec0}. This requires the generation of a type descriptor. And this descriptor must include not only field \code{p}, but also the hidden field \code{q}. This is achieved by also extending the condition \code{typ.form} = \code{ORB.Pointer} in \code{ORG.FindPtrFlds} to (\code{typ.form} = \code{ORB.Pointer}) \lor\ (\code{typ.form} = \code{ORB.NilTyp}).

\beginsubsection 12.7. THE CODE GENERATOR.

The routines for generating instructions are contained in a single module: \code{ORG}. They are fairly numerous, and therefore the interface of \code{ORG} is quite large. It is a procedural interface. This implies that there is no ``intermediate code'' or ``intermediate data structure'' between parser and code generator. This is one reason for the compactness of the code generator. The other is the regularity and simplicity of the processor architecture. In order to understand the following material, the reader is supposed to be familiar with this architecture (Appendix 2) and the generated code patterns for individual language constructs (Section 12.2).

A distinguishing feature of this compiler is that parsing proceeds top-down according to the principle of recursive descent in the parsing tree. This implies that for every syntactic construct a specific procedure is called. It carries the same name as the construct. It also implies that properties of the parsed construct can be represented by parameters of the parsing procedures. Consider, for example, the construct of simple expression:
\begintt
  SimpleExpression = term {"+" term}.
\endtt

\noindent The corresponding parsing procedure is
\begintt
PROCEDURE SimpleExpression(VAR x: Item);
  VAR y: Item;
BEGIN term(x);
  WHILE sym = plus DO ORS.Get(sym); term(y); ORG.AddOp(x, y) END
END SimpleExpression
\endtt

\noindent The generating procedure \code{AddOp} receives two parameters representing the operands, and returns the result through the first parameter. This scheme carries the invaluable advantage of using operands efficiently allocated on the stack rather than dynamically allocated on the heap and subject to automatic storage retrieval (garbage collection). Here the processed operands quietly disappear from the stack upon exit from the parser procedure.

The parameters representing syntactic constructs are of type \code{Item} defined in \code{ORG}. This data type is rather similar to the type \code{Object} (in \code{ORB}). After all, it serves the same purpose; but it represents internal items rather than declared objects.
\begintt
TYPE Item = RECORD
  mode: INTEGER;
  type: ORB.Type;
  a, b, r: INTEGER;
  rdo: BOOLEAN (*read only*)
END
\endtt

\noindent The attribute class of \code{Object} is renamed mode in \code{Item}. In fact, in some sense different classes evoke different (corresponding) addressing modes as featured by the processor architecture. According to the architecture, additional modes may have to be introduced. Thanks to the simplicity of \RISC, only three are needed:

\item{\bullet} \code{Reg} = 10; The item \code{x} is located in register \code{x.r}
\item{\bullet} \code{RegI} = 11; The item \code{x} is addressed indirectly through register \code{x.r} plus offset \code{x.a}
\item{\bullet} \code{Cond} = 12; The item is represented by the condition bit registers

\noindent Instructions are emitted sequentially and emitted by the four procedures \code{Put0}, \code{Put1}, \code{Put2}, \code{Put3}. They directly correspond to the instruction formats of the \RISC processor (see Chapter 11). The instructions are stored in the array code and the compiler variable \code{pc} serves as running index.
\begintt
PROCEDURE Put0(op, a, b, c: INTEGER); format F0
PROCEDURE Put1(op, a, b, im: INTEGER); format F1
PROCEDURE Put2(op, a, b, off: INTEGER); format F2
PROCEDURE Put3(op, cond, off: INTEGER); format F3
\endtt

\beginsubsubsection 12.7.1. Expressions.

Expressions consist of operands and operators. They are evaluated and have a value. First, a number of make-procedures transform objects into items (see Section 12.3.2). The principal one is \code{MakeItem}. Typical objects are variables (\code{class}, \code{mode} = \code{Var}). Global variables are addressed with base register \code{SB} (\code{x.r} = 13), local variables with the stack pointer \code{SP} (\code{x.r} = 14). \code{VAR}-parameters are addressed indirectly; the address is on the stack (\code{class}, \code{mode} = \code{Par}, \code{Ind}). \code{x.a} is the offset from the stack pointer.

Before an operator can be applied to operands, these must first be transferred (loaded) into registers. This is because the \RISC performs operations only on registers. The loading is achieved by procedure \code{load} (and \code{loadAdr}) in \code{ORG}. The resulting mode is \code{Reg}. In allocating registers, a strict stack principle is used, starting with \code{R0}, up to \code{R11}. This is certainly not an optimal strategy and provides ample room for improvement (usually called optimization). The compiler variable \code{RH} indicates the next free register (top of register stack).

Base address \code{SB} is, as the name suggests, static. But this holds only within a module. It implies that on every transfer to a procedure in another module, the static base must be adjusted. The simplest way is to load \code{SB} before every external call, and to restore it to its old value after return from the procedure. We chose a different strategy: loading on demand (see below: global variables).

If a variable is indexed, has a field selector, is dereferenced, or has a type guard, this is detected in the parser by procedure selector. It calls generators \code{Index}, \code{Field}, \code{DeRef}, or \code{TypeTest} accordingly (see Section 12.3.2. and patterns 1 - 4 in Section 12.2). These procedures cause item modes to change as follows:

TODO: table

A fairly large number of procedures then deal with individual operators. Specifically, they are \code{Not}, \code{And1}, \code{And2}, \code{Or1}, \code{Or2} for \code{Boolean} operators, \code{Neg}, \code{AddOp}, \code{MulOp}, \code{DivOp} for operations on integers, \code{RealOp} for operations on real numbers, and \code{Singleton}, \code{Set}, \code{In}, and \code{SetOp} for operations on \code{Sets}. And finally, following the same pattern, are the procedures for relations (comparisons) \code{IntRelation}, \code{SetRelation}, \code{RealRelation}, \code{StringRelation}. (see Appendix for listing of \code{ORG}). We note in particular that if all operands are constants, their evaluation is performed by the compiler and not delegated to run-time. This is an important efficiency factor.

\beginsubsubsection 12.7.2. Relations.

\RISC\ does not feature any compare instruction. Instead, subtraction is used, because an implicit comparison with 0 is performed along with any arithmetic (or load) instruction. Instead of $x < y$ we use $x-y < 0$. This is possible, because in addition to the computed difference deposited in a register, also the result of the comparison is deposited in the condition flags \code{N} (difference negative) and \code{Z} (difference zero). Relations therefore yield a result item \code{x} with mode \code{Cond}. \code{x.r} (= \code{relmap[sym]}) identifies the relation. Branch instructions (jumps) are executed conditionally depending on these flags. The value \code{x.r} is then used when generating branch instructions. For example, the relation $x < y$ is translated simply into
\begintt
LDR R0, SP, x
LDR R1, SP, y
CMP R0, R0, R1
\endtt

\noindent and the resulting item mode \code{is x.mode = Cond}, \code{x.r := "less"}. (The mnemonic \code{CMP} is synonymous with \code{SUB}). More about relations and Boolean expressions will be explained in Section 12.7.6.

\beginsubsubsection 12.7.3. Set operations.

The type \code{SET} represents sets of small integers in the range from 0 to 31. Bit \code{i} being 1 signals that \code{i} is an element of the set. This is a convenient representation, because the logical instructions directly mirror the set operations: \code{AND} implements set intersection, \code{OR} set union, and \code{XOR} the symmetric set difference. This representation also allows a simple and efficient implementation of membership tests. The instructions for the expression \code{n IN s} is generated by procedure \code{In}. Assuming the value \code{n} in register \code{R0}, and the set \code{s} in \code{R1}, we obtain
\begintt
ADD R0, R0, 1
ROR R1, R1, R0 rotate s by i+1 position, the relevant bit moving to the sign bit
\endtt

\noindent The resulting item mode is \code{Cond} with \code{x.r = "minus"}.

Of some interest are the procedures for generating sets, i.e. for processing \code{$\{$m$\}$}, \code{$\{$m..n$\}$}, and \code{$\{$m, n$\}$}, where \code{m}, \code{n} are integer expressions.

We start with \code{$\{$m$\}$}. It is generated by procedure \code{Singleton} using a shift instruction. Assuming \code{m} in \code{R0}, the resulting code is
\begintt
MOV R1, 0, 1
LSL R0, R1, R0 shift 1 by m bit positions to the left
\endtt

\noindent Somewhat more sophisticated is the generation of \code{$\{$m..n$\}$} by procedure \code{Set}. Assuming \code{m} in \code{R0}, and \code{n} is \code{R1}, the resulting code is
\begintt
MOV R2, 0, -2
LSL R1, R2, R1 shift -2 by n bit positions to the left
MOV R2, 0, -1
LSL R0, R2, R0 shift -1 by m bit positions to the left
XOR R0, R0, R1
\endtt

\noindent The set \code{$\{$m, n$\}$} is generated as the union of \code{$\{$m$\}$} and \code{$\{$n$\}$}. If any of the element values is a constant, several possibilities of code improvement are possible. For details, the reader is referred to the source code of \code{ORG}.

\beginsubsubsection 12.7.4. Assignments.

Statements have an effect, but no result like expressions. Statements are executed, not evaluated. Assignments alter the value of variables through store instructions. The computation of the address of the affected variable follows the same scheme as for loading. The value to be assigned must be in a register.

Assignments of arrays (and records) are an exceptional case in so far as they are performed not by a single store instruction, but by a repetition. Consider \code{y := x}, where \code{x}, and \code{y} are both arrays of n integers. Assuming that the address of \code{y} is in register \code{R0}, that of \code{x} in \code{R1}, and the value \code{n} in \code{R2}. Then the resulting code is
